This is a bit more demanding than what other Players are required to do in the game, but not by much, and this whole chapter exists to teach you, guide you, and support you in playing the World as effectively and comfortably as possible; follow these instructions closely, because all the other procedures in the game are built upon them.</p><hr /><h2><strong>4.1 - Agenda</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Play to find out</strong></li><li><strong>Make sense</strong></li><li><strong>Rock the boat</strong></li></ul><p>These three goals are your Agenda, the three things you should strive to accomplish during the game with every single word you say and choice you make. <strong>It is not your job</strong> to entertain an audience of Players. <strong>It is not your job</strong> to be a judge of good roleplay or an arbiter of fair challenges. <strong>It is not your job</strong> to be the adversary, to defeat the Protagonists, to deny them what they want, to punish them, to control them, or to surprise them by yanking the rug out from under their feet. Most of all, <strong>it is not your job</strong> to pre-plan a storyline.</p><p><strong>So what is your job?</strong> I’m glad you asked...</p><h3><strong>Play to Find Out</strong></h3><p>It has already been mentioned a bunch of times that playing to find out <strong>is the main goal of the game</strong> for both World and Players alike. You do it by coming to the table with dreams and ideas and desires, by imagining a world full of mystical places, weird creatures, and unusual peoples, but <strong>never clinging to them</strong>.</p><p>Things might come to pass as you imagine them, or differently, or not at all. <strong>Any</strong> outcome is a good one for you because your core directive is “<em>this is cool, now I wonder what will happen next!</em>”. The rest of this chapter offers plenty of practical tools to help you achieve this easily, and then make the most out of it.</p><h3><strong>Make Sense</strong></h3><p>As World you don’t need (nor want) to be a novel writer, movie director, or even a storyteller. You just need to make both the setting and the characters within it <strong>feel lifelike and reasonable</strong>. There are two easy ways to achieve this.</p><p>One is to <strong>communicate</strong>. What looks sensible to you might seem baffling to someone else, so then what good is it? So don't ever expect others to \"get you;\" instead, offer them your ideas, voice your opinions and concerns, but also <strong>listen</strong> to the others and be <strong>ready to accept their input</strong>. Be ready to compromise, and to help others compromise as well.</p><p>Two is to <strong>do the obvious thing</strong> as much as possible. <strong>Be banal</strong>! Use narrative archetypes, stereotypes, and clichés you know and love. Don’t try to be clever, mysterious, and unpredictable. Instead, portray everything <strong>transparently</strong>: people, monsters, animals, even the land and the plants and the weather. Start by making your world <strong>consistent</strong> and <strong>predictable</strong>; this will make it feel <strong>reasonable</strong>, solid and I dare say realistic. Surprises will later emerge spontaneously.</p><h3><strong>Rock the Boat</strong></h3><p>Protagonists’ lives should be interesting, adventurous, and dramatic. There are good ways and bad ways to achieve these goals. Rocking the boat <strong>is not</strong> about coming up with implausible plot twists or stealing victory away from Protagonists when they least expect it. Instead, you can rock the boat in a <em>play-to-find-out</em> way just by looking at your NPCs, finding out what they want, and having them <strong>act to get it</strong>.</p><p>This could mean <strong>something big</strong>: a street thug wants a better life <strong>so</strong> they start a gang that stirs up trouble in the city; an orc warrior wants to become a hero <strong>so</strong> they raise an army to invade the human lands; a heartbroken magician wants to bring a loved one back to life <strong>so</strong> they mess around with dark powers that could threaten the realm.</p><p>This could also mean <strong>something small</strong>: someone wants to help a Protagonist but ends up being in the way and creating trouble; someone wants personal gain and is willing to go against a Protagonist for it; someone wants something but incidentally, a Protagonist is in their way.</p><p>Character... desire... action... <strong>this</strong> is how you <em>Rock the boat</em>.</p><hr /><h2><strong>4.2 - Always Say</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>What the principles demand</strong></li><li><strong>What the rules demand</strong></li><li><strong>What your prep demands</strong></li><li><strong>What honesty demands</strong></li></ul><p>In <em>Fantasy World</em> each <strong>Player</strong> says what their Protagonist says and does, what they think, feel and remember, and answers questions about their lives and surroundings.</p><p>As the <strong>World,</strong> you instead say everything else: how the environment appears and behaves, and what every Non-Protagonist Character says,does,thinks, and feels.</p><p>Whether you are the World or a Protagonist, be sure that among the things you say, you also <em>Always say</em> the things demanded in the list above. Here is why:</p><h3><strong>What the principles demand</strong></h3><p>In the next section you’ll be presented with a short list of <strong>Principles</strong>, things you should strive to <strong>do</strong> in order to better achieve the goals set in your Agenda. <em>Always say what the principles demand</em>.</p><h3><strong>What the rules demand</strong></h3><p>The game <strong>rules</strong> are meant to manipulate and shape the conversation happening between Players in unique ways. Rules will ask you to say some things or to say things in a specific way. This is what helps you all experience an engaging and unique story without the effort and skill that writing a novel would require. <em>Always say what the rules demand</em>.</p><h3><strong>What your prep demands</strong></h3><p>Even without pre-planning you will end up <strong>preparing</strong> some material, making <strong>decisions</strong> about what the environment looks like and how the NPCs act and react, putting down in writing lists of things, facts, events, and all sorts of other details. Be true to your ideas and clear in relaying them. <em>Always say what your prep demands</em>.</p><h3><strong>What honesty demands</strong></h3><p>The Players depend on the World to give them <strong>real</strong> information they can use to imagine and understand what’s happening around their Protagonists. Being abundantly clear and honest is always your best policy. Play with integrity and an open hand, as the Protagonists are entitled to the full benefits (and consequences) of their moves, their rolls, their resources. Don’t withhold information, don’t weasel out of plain answers, <strong>don’t play gotchas</strong>. <em>Always say what honesty demands</em>.</p><hr /><h2><strong>4.3 - The Principles</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Drape the rules in fiction</strong></li><li><strong>Portray simple people</strong></li><li><strong>Kill your darlings mercilessly</strong></li><li><strong>Be a fan of the protagonists</strong></li><li><strong>Think off-screen too</strong></li><li><strong>Ask honest questions</strong></li></ul><p>Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundation for all the systems in the game. Here they are expressed as actions: do this thing to obtain this effect, do this other thing to create this feeling, etc. They are meant to be <strong>practical tools</strong> the World uses to achieve the goals set by the game's <strong>Agenda</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Drape the Rules in Fiction</strong></h3><p>In order to <em>Make Sense</em> you need to summon the illusion of a lifelike and reasonable world. One tool to achieve such an aim is to <strong>drape the rules in fiction</strong>. Here are some practical applications:</p><h4><strong>Talk to the Protagonists, not to the Players</strong></h4><p>Don’t address the other Players by their real names; instead, <strong>speak directly to the Protagonist characters</strong>. This helps Players to stay in-fiction throughout the play session, but it also makes it starkly clear when you are addressing the Player about an out-of-game issue, which is particularly useful when dealing with the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em>.</p><blockquote><p>Address the Protagonist: \"Lady Deanna, do you want to kill or spare him?\"</p><p>Not the Player: \"Julia, does Lady Deanna want to kill or spare him?\"</p><p>Unless Needed: \"Julia, is it ok for you if I describe Lady Deanna this way?\"</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Fake Causality</strong></h4><p>When you use a <em>World Reaction</em> (explained in just a little while) <strong>pretend to do it because of in-fiction </strong>(diegetic)<strong> reasons</strong>. That’s a ruse of course; you do it because of something that happened at the table: someone describes something relevant, somebody misses a roll, some mechanic calls for you to answer, somebody’s waiting for you to say something.</p><p>You react because of the failed roll. But you chose <strong>this Reaction</strong> because it was fitting the fictional situation. And then you described it <strong>as if</strong> its effect was a natural consequence of the characters’ actions, an obvious <strong>cause-and-effect</strong> within the fiction.</p><blockquote><p>Player - I try to fast-talk the guards into letting me and Deanna be.</p><p>A move is rolled, but it results in a Snag. This leads the World to select a Reaction. In this case, they choose to Take Away Their People.</p><p>BAD World - You miss the roll, so you two get separated!</p><p>GOOD World - They seem outraged by your bullshit, so they shove you aside and drag Deanna away!</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Don't Name the Reaction</strong></h4><p>By the same token, <strong>never just say the name of the Reaction</strong> you use. Instead, describe its effects in fiction.</p><p>If your Reaction is to <em>Take Away Their People</em> don’t just state “<em>you get separated</em>” but describe the guards dragging Deanna away.</p><p>If your Reaction is to <em>Inflict harm</em> don’t just state “<em>the attack inflicts Temp harm</em>” but describe how a guard steps forward and viciously hits the Protagonist in the back with the butt of a pike.</p><p><strong>You can</strong> also specify the mechanical effects if something is not immediately clear and obvious. And <strong>you must</strong> answer honestly if a Player asks you for clarifications. But never, ever, just state the mechanical effect without <strong>first</strong> describing how it looks in the fiction.</p><blockquote><p>Fiction First, Mechanics Later: \"The guard hits you like this ... it looks like Temp harm.\"</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Be Honest</strong></h4><p>These techniques are never meant to hide the rules or to keep the World's actions secret and unintelligible. They just mean that you should convey this info in a <strong>fictional</strong> way whenever possible. And if a Player asks “<em>Wait, which Reaction was that?!</em>” you should be open and forthcoming about it. Rules are not a dirty thing to be hidden away. Answer plainly, say the name of the Reaction, explain your reasoning and process. <strong>This is very useful for the World to properly learn how to wield the mechanics of this game</strong>.</p><p>Once you do what it takes to be honest, go back to a fiction-first approach and do whatever you can to drape all your game actions in a veil of fiction.</p><h3><strong>Portray Simple People</strong></h3><p>This is part of how you can both <em>Make Sense</em> and <em>Rock the Boat</em>. First of all, you need to <strong>give a name</strong> to all your NPCs. As soon as they get even a single line of dialogue or any significant on-screen action, name them.</p><p>But names are only the beginning. Find one striking physical feature in each NPC, <strong>a body part</strong>. What NPCs do in life is <strong>follow their </strong><em><strong>parts</strong></em><strong> around</strong> - their nose, their stomach, their big ears, their genitals, their gut, their childish smile, their crazy hair, their wide eyes, their clenched fist, their broken heart. And they are pretty straightforward about it! They do what they want to do when they want to do it, and if something gets in their way they deal with it <strong>now</strong>.</p><p>Whenever possible make <strong>everyone</strong> into <em>Simple People.</em> Be they kings or farmers, give them a simple drive, and have them act according to it. Actually, make <strong>anything capable of action</strong> into <em>Simple People</em>: animals, monsters, talking swords, sentient plants, even places if you can imagine a metaphorical way for them to have a drive and to act on it.</p><p>Once you have <em>Simple People</em> at hand, make sure that their uncomplicated self-interests involve the Protagonists <strong>individually</strong>, not as a group. Show different sides of their personalities to the different Protagonists in play.</p><blockquote><p>How to Name a Name</p><p>Names are both trivial and very important.</p><p>Trivial, because you need to produce a ton of names. And you don't know whether they will stick around or be forgotten after a couple of scenes. So don't stress. Just slap any name on a new NPC and be done with it. Or ask the Players to come up with names, who cares?!</p><p>Important, because extremes matter. A particularly silly or bad name can ruin the illusion of a story that Makes Sense. Likewise, a particularly apt or memorable name can be enough to turn a random NPC into a recurring character. Mind the extremes; avoid the bad, embrace the good.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Kill Your Darlings Mercilessly</strong></h3><p>Whenever your attention lands on someone or something that you own, <strong>consider killing it</strong>, overthrowing it, burning it down, blowing it up. Be it an individual NPC, a faction of NPCs, some arrangement between NPCs, even an entire reign or civilization, consider razing it to the ground.</p><p>This plays right into <em>Rocking the Boat</em>: no champion is unbeatable, no fortress is impregnable, no pact is unbreakable. This keeps the terrain shifting under the Protagonists feet, for good or ill. They might be able to accomplish great feats that will change the world but are also <strong>never safe from danger and uncertainty</strong>. There are two sides to this coin.</p><p>One, the Protagonists will try to break your things, <strong>so let them</strong>. By all means show them a good fight, toy around with tactics, maneuvering, threats, and everything that leads up to the moment of real violence; but as soon as your NPCs suffer harm you should consider <strong>breaking</strong> them: defeated, wounded, incapacitated, scared, demoralised, find a way to have them <strong>stop fighting</strong>. The harm effects give you plenty of options. Unless violence is truly of dramatic importance, you should keep it as <strong>short and to the point</strong> as possible. This actually enhances its narrative effect, making harm feel brutal and dangerous.</p><p>Two, break your own things <strong>because you can</strong>. Protagonists go around doing stuff and this is all good and well, but actions have consequences. Have <strong>others</strong> pay for the Protagonists’ actions. Remember your <strong>simple people</strong>; NPCs might balk at the idea of going against the Protagonists and therefore might choose easier targets like a family of peasants or a young servant. Or the Protagonists’ allies could be less careful and subtle than what the Players hope for. Or they might leverage the Protagonists’ presence and actions to settle personal grudges and scores. It’s all your stuff, after all, so <strong>put your bloody fingerprints on everything you touch</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Be a Fan of the Protagonists</strong></h3><p>Being a fan of the Protagonists means that you like them and want to see more of them. So <strong>always avoid</strong> taking away the things that make the Protagonists cool to begin with:the Veteran’s ancestral weapon, but also the Veteran’s collection of poems that they don’t allow anyone to read. The things that make the Protagonists match our expectations and also what makes them rise above them. Don’t take those away. At least, not for prolonged periods of time.</p><p>But an easy life of constant success with no real challenge is rarely interesting, both to experience firsthand and to witness unfold. <em>Fantasy World</em> mechanics will see that this does not come to pass, giving you the right tools to <em>Rock the Boat</em>. But rocking the boat doesn’t mean sinking it.</p><p>The best way to avoid such extremes is to strive to <em>Make Sense</em>. And a very easy way to achieve this is to have Protagonists’ actions be <strong>consequential</strong>. Always give the Protagonists what they work for, but then ask yourself: how will my NPCs respond? Reevaluate the things driving your <em>Simple People</em>. Whose needs change? Whose opinions change? Who was an enemy, but now is afraid? Whose allegiances have shifted? Who benefits from recent changes? Who gets hurt by them?</p><p>Let the Protagonists’ successes <strong>ripple outward</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Think Offscreen Too</strong></h3><p>When it’s time for you to React, imagine what your various NPCs must have been doing in the meantime. Have any of them done something offscreen that now becomes evident? Are any of them doing things offscreen that, while invisible to the Protagonists, deserve your quiet acknowledgement? This is part of having the setting <em>Make Sense</em> and, if you pay attention to your Agents (explained in a little while), is part of <em>Rocking the Boat</em> too.</p><p>But if you spend your Reaction to develop stuff off screen, what should happen <strong>on screen</strong>? Nine times out of ten the best option is to <strong>gift the Protagonists with a success</strong>. Success can move things forward much better than failure, and it’s also easier to improvise: just give the Protagonist what they were trying to get. Besides, you <strong>did</strong> react, you <strong>did</strong> change things, so it’s not like the Protagonists are getting a free pass.</p><p>A great thing to do when you develop an off-screen situation is to put an Hourglass on it (chapter 4 section 5). This will be explained better in a later chapter, but it basically means that you have a way to keep track of the progress of an ongoing situation developing in the background.</p><blockquote><p>In a nutshell</p><p>Reward them ON screen while you (amicably) mess with them OFF screen.</p><p>Do it while keeping true to the Be a Fan principle, and everything will be fine.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Ask Honest Questions</strong></h3><p>Playing the role of World doesn’t mean you have to know everything about everything; after all, you are <strong>playing to find out</strong> too! By asking honest questions you can make your job as World both <strong>easier</strong> and <strong>more fun</strong> when it comes to three important areas:</p><ul><li>Creating new content on the fly.</li><li>Making decisions you’d rather not make.</li><li>Finding ways to engage the Players and leverage their Protagonists.</li></ul><h4><strong>Create New Content</strong></h4><p>When you need to <strong>come up with content</strong> for the setting, ask a specific Player for an explanation of how something in the game world is or how it works. Try to do this <strong>only</strong> when your question touches on an obvious <strong>interest or expertise</strong> of their Protagonist, and <strong>keep it specific</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>BAD question: \"Occultist, how does magic work?\"</p><p>This is a terrible question. Too big, too vague, too abstract.</p><p>GOOD question: \"Occultist, is magic immoral or illegal where you come from?\"</p><p>This is much better. It's easy to answer, just a detail, but ripe with potential consequences.</p><p>More Good Examples: \"Troubadour, have you ever been in this city before?\" \"Wayfarer, which plant grows in this region that can serve your purpose? What does it look like? Does it have a unique smell?\"</p></blockquote><h4><strong>Delegate Decisions</strong></h4><p>When you need to <strong>make decisions you don’t want</strong> to make yourself, you can ask...</p><ul><li><p>... an <strong>NPC</strong> what to do by honestly asking yourself, “<em>What would this NPC do in this situation?</em>” Yes, you are still making the decision yourself, but this gives you a way to make it with integrity and to help you figure out what could <em>Make Sense</em>.</p></li><li><p>... <em>Mother When &amp; Father Time</em> what to do, which is to say you can avoid the decision by turning it into an Hourglass. Again, you are making the decision yourself, but this way it might or might not happen because of how future events unfold, not because of an immediate arbitrary decision; it also gives you the time and means to plan its execution instead of just winging it.</p></li><li><p>... the <strong>Protagonists</strong> what to do by asking them what they would <strong>do here and now</strong> about the thing you are deciding on. So don’t ask yourself “<em>Will Samara live?</em>” but instead ask them “<em>Samara is gravely wounded, what do you do?</em>”. If they do nothing, she dies. If they somehow help, she lives. Be honest! After all, you wanted them to decide for you, why cheat?</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Engage the Players</strong></h4><p>When you need help figuring out <strong>how to engage</strong> the Players, but also to have things and events <em>Make Sense</em> for them specifically and to <em>Rock the Boat</em> for them in a personal way, your best option is to ask a Player for <strong>immediate and intimate</strong> details about their Protagonist’s experience. Immediate, as in where they are, what they would do, how they would do it, why they are doing it. Intimate, as in how they <strong>feel</strong> about it, what they <strong>think</strong> about it. Are they afraid or excited? Have they thought about the other person’s perspective? Do they think of themselves as righteous and heroic? Why? How?</p><p>Keep an eye on the Protagonists’ Issue and Doubt and compare them to their actions and thoughts, then ask questions about what you see: do they match? Do they diverge? What does this say about the Protagonist as a person? By doing so you will uncover the things the Protagonists (and their Players) truly care about and are invested in.</p><p>But asking questions is only half of it. The other half is <strong>putting the answers to good use</strong>:</p><ul><li>Use them to inform your own aesthetic, incorporating them and their implications into your own vision.</li><li>Refer to them later in play, bringing them back up into current events.</li><li>Build on them, adding details and imagery of your own.</li></ul><blockquote><p>World - So Lady Ennoia threatens the burgomaster and gets the info she needed. How does she feel about this? How does this fit with her Doubt \"I don't want to be like my father\"?</p><p>Player - Oh shit, I did not think about that. She... she laughs at the man's cowardice. But inside she feels uneasy, although maybe she doesn't really see why. I mean, father was way worse than this!</p><p>World - Sure. If you say so...</p><p>Player - You are evil!</p><p>World - Thanks.</p></blockquote><hr /><h2><strong>4.4 - World Reactions</strong></h2><ul><li>Hit the Issue / Feed the Doubt</li><li>Show signs of trouble</li><li>Highlight a downside</li><li>Show an opportunity</li><li>Reveal an unwelcome truth</li><li>Take away their stuff</li><li>Take away their people</li><li>Turn their move back on them</li><li>Inflict harm</li><li>Put them at a Disadvantage</li><li>Make an Agent Reaction</li><li>After <strong>every</strong> move ask “<em>what do you do?</em>”</li></ul><p><strong>Success</strong> is always an effective way to move things forward in interesting and meaningful ways. When in doubt, grant success and then focus on <strong>what happens next</strong>, on the consequences and ramifications. But success is not always available or, if you want to <em>Rock the boat</em>, not always desirable. <em>World Reactions</em> are an effective way to change the situation and set the stage for future action.</p><p>It is important to notice, though, that Reactions are <strong>not</strong> meant to always be problematic or challenging. They are <strong>not</strong> a way for the World to “punish” an unlucky roll or a poor decision. They are meant to make Protagonists’ lives interesting, to achieve your <strong>Agenda,</strong> and to implement your <strong>Principles</strong>. This sometimes means challenging and even hurting (<em>or killing!</em>) the PCs, but other times could mean giving them unexpectedly good news, revealing tempting opportunities, or allowing for some respite. Part of the World’s job is to judge how to best use their Reactions on a case-by-case basis during active play.</p><p>Reactions are not moves. They have no fictional trigger, no dice roll, no attached mechanical effects; they simply make something happen in the fictional reality of the game. Since the World has to <em>Drape the Rules in Fiction</em>, the end result of a Reaction is <strong>simply a short narration</strong>: the NPCs say and do stuff, the consequences of some action are shown, some meaningful detail is brought to the Protagonists’ attention. And then <strong>always</strong> add: “<em>What do you do?</em>”</p><h3><strong>Open &amp; Closed</strong></h3><p>Reactions can be performed in an <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Closed</strong> way, and then the World is allowed to perform one, <strong>and only one</strong>, of their Reactions when...</p><ul><li><strong>[Open]</strong> ...the Protagonists somehow <strong>look at the World</strong> to know what happens next.</li><li><strong>[Open]</strong> ...the Protagonists (not the Players) <strong>waste</strong> <strong>time</strong> or <strong>wait</strong> for something to happen.</li><li><strong>[Open or Closed]</strong> ...a move calls for a Reaction.</li><li><strong>[Open or Closed]</strong> ...the consequences of a <strong>previous Open</strong> Reaction come together without interference.</li></ul><p>An <strong>Open</strong> Reaction is a Reaction that offers the Protagonists some opportunity to act and respond. <strong>It’s a start</strong> to the action, not its conclusion. It’s how you <strong>set up</strong> events for future <strong>Closed</strong> Reactions.</p><p>A <strong>Closed</strong> Reaction is something the Protagonists can’t avoid or prevent anymore. It’s not necessarily a mean or cruel Reaction, but simply a <strong>definitive</strong> one.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, Reactions <strong>are always Open</strong> unless the proper conditions apply. When the proper conditions apply, a Reaction can be either <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Closed</strong> as the World sees fit.</p><h3><strong>The Right Time and Place</strong></h3><p>Whenever possible, Reactions should happen <strong>almost immediately</strong>. The World should avoid at all costs situations where they delay a Reaction so much that it might end up being forgotten, lost in the flow of play, or, even worse, when multiple Reactions pile up. In the former case, the game would feel bland, while in the latter it would seem punitive. If for any reason the World doesn’t feel like messing with a situation when they should perform a Reaction, the right thing to do is to <strong>shift the Reaction somewhere else</strong>.</p><p>It’s important to understand that Reactions <strong>are not tied to their source</strong>. A Player does something that grants a Reaction to the World, then the World does something somewhere to change the fiction <strong>of the game</strong>, not necessarily the fiction tied to the Player’s action. Sure, the World will often find it obvious and desirable to React in a way that has to do with the source of the Reaction...</p><blockquote><p>The Scoundrel rolls a Snag and the World comes up with a Reaction (Open or Closed) that has to do with the situation the PC is in. It could look like a direct consequence (you tripped an alarm) or just a chance event (guards happen to pass by).</p></blockquote><p>...but it is also possible, and can be very effective and convenient, to perform the Reaction in a way that has nothing to do with its source. This has many benefits:</p><ul><li>It helps with keeping <em><strong>Spotlight Management</strong></em> dynamic, shifting the focus from one PC/situation to a different PC/situation.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Zamtar (Wayfarer) gets to a roof and settles in, monitoring the activity of his mark.</p><p>Just waiting around for stuff to happen gives the World an Open Reaction, which they use to make something happen somewhere else...</p><p>\"...in the meantime... Bolana (Occultist), you hear a sudden knocking at the door...\"</p></blockquote><ul><li>It helps manage the <strong>Difficulty</strong> of a situation, giving a breather to some PCs while applying more pressure to others.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Gaelan (Veteran) is valiantly fighting a rock troll but is probably in over her head, so when she rolls a Snag, the World looks at the other PCs and, seeing how Fruss (the Priest) is still unharmed, uses the available Reaction to put them under more pressure.</p><p>\"Infuriated by Gaelan's attacks, the rock troll rampages around the cave causing the earth to shake and some stones to fall. Fruss, one is about to crush you! What do you do?\"</p></blockquote><ul><li>It helps the World when they have no clear idea how to change one situation, allowing them to instead change a different situation that right now comes easier to them.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Some NPCs are negotiating a trade, with Trax (Knight) supervising the event. Trax is kind of just waiting to see what happens, giving an Open Reaction to the World. But the World too is not yet sure how to proceed, so they spend their Open Reaction on a situation that is much clearer in their head.</p><p>\"Deanna (Troubadour) you manage to meet Lasher, but she has a worried expression on her face...\"</p></blockquote><ul><li>it helps the World to <em>Think Offscreen Too</em>, as they can use the Reaction to push events forward that are evolving in the background</li></ul><blockquote><p>The PCs are caught up in a tense and hectic situation when one of them rolls a Snag.</p><p>The World doesn't want to make a complicated situation even more difficult, so instead, they look at their notes. It turns out that a band of marauders was supposed to attack the village, sooner or later, and there was even an Hourglass tracking it. The World thus opts to advance that Hourglass. Nothing needs to be described right now, or at least not while the PCs are so fervently engaged, but the game state has changed and the World will somehow communicate it as soon as the PCs get out of the immediate pickle.</p></blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>World Reactions List</strong></h3><h4><strong>Hit the Issue / Feed the Doubt</strong></h4><p>This is your first and best Reaction because it hits the Protagonists “<em>right in the feels</em>”.</p><p>Look at the target PC’s Issue and Doubt.</p><p>Then come up with something that could embody/represent one or the other in the current situation. This something could interact directly with the PC, or it could happen to someone else, or it could even just happen in the background if it is still clearly visible to the PC. This indirect approach is usually the easiest <strong>and</strong> most effective option. Either way, describe how the PC “notices” what is going on. And that’s it! Your Reaction is done.</p><p>Whether the PC acts on your provocation or ignores it, it will <strong>mean</strong> something. Take note of it. Ask questions (now or later) about it. Either way, your job as World is fulfilled. This Reaction often produces something interesting to talk about during the <em><strong>End of Session</strong></em> move, which gives the Player a chance to mark a Growth, and you a chance to better understand what pushes the Player’s buttons.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>PC Issue</strong><em><strong> = the king’s tyranny</strong></em></p><p><strong>World</strong> - While you flirt with the innkeeper’s son you notice two royal guards.

Imagine some sort of “<em><strong>Meanwhile...</strong></em>” situation that has happened, is happening, or will happen somewhere else. Make a note of it, and maybe advance or create an Hourglass to track its progress. Finally, be sure to show signs of it as soon as possible, ideally within the current scene or the next one.</p><p>Of all the Reactions, <em>Showing Signs of Trouble</em> is probably the most difficult to clearly distinguish between its Open and Closed versions. Fortunately, it’s also the one that causes the least trouble when accidentally mishandled. In a way, you can’t go wrong. Just <strong>be mindful</strong> of what you are supposed to do mechanically, and then narrate what comes easier and more naturally.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - The door is old damp wood, so if the <em>dugbar</em> rats start chewing on it, it won’t last more than a few minutes. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - The <em>dugbar</em> rats are chewing through the door and will enter any minute now. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>World</strong> - You scare the thugs away but their boss shouts “<em>This is not over! You hear me? This is not over!</em>”<br />[<strong>Hourglass</strong> : [<em>tension with the Red Capes</em>]</p></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You notice a tattoo on the smuggler’s neck... it’s the same the <em>Red Capes</em> wear! But the smuggler notices you noticing, and his expression changes - eyes darting towards a patch of darkness to the right, deeper in the alleyway. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - The king invites you to stay at court, but you notice how various courtesans seem inexplicably tense about it. <em>What do you do?</em> Do you accept the offer?</td><td><strong>World</strong> - The king invites you to stay at court, but before you can say anything you recognise a face in the crowd of courtesans and dignitaries: the Duke of Lanverse is looking at you with hostility. It’s obvious he doesn’t want you at court. <em>What do you do?</em> Do you accept the offer?</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Highlight a Downside</strong></h4><p>This Reaction has less to do with thwarting or limiting the Protagonists’ actions, and more to do with having things <em>Make Sense</em> and with <em>Rocking the Boat</em>. Simply look at the Tags present in the current situation and describe (highlight) how one is, or could be, problematic. Look at the Protagonists’ <strong>Equipment</strong>, their <strong>Blood</strong> or <strong>Kin</strong> or <strong>Class</strong>, their <strong>harm effects</strong> or any other environmental Tag present.</p><p>Alternatively, you might sometimes create a new Tag to represent the effects of a specific circumstance on a person, object, or location. When you do so, write it down and communicate it to the Players.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - If you let them get closer, the goblins will be too close for you to use your <em><strong>[huge]</strong></em> dragon-slayer sword.<em> What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - The goblins are too close for you to use your <em><strong>[huge]</strong></em> dragon-slayer sword. <em>What do you do instead?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - You are about to talk to the inn-keeper about the steep prices when you notice how everyone in the room seems to give you the stink-eye, and you even overhear someone mutter “<em><strong>[half-blood</strong></em>]<em> scum</em>” under their breath. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You start haggling for a better price at the tavern when the inn-keeper brusquely interrupts you, spits on the floor, and says “<em>You know what? We don’t have rooms for <strong>[half-blood]</strong> scum like you. Piss off!</em>” <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - A villager throws a tomato at you, nothing serious. But when your <em><strong>[wolf companion]</strong></em> sees you get hit by something and then start dripping red, she starts growling and tensing up, ready to jump at the assailant’s throat. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - A villager throws a tomato at you, nothing serious. But when your <em><strong>[wolf companion]</strong></em> sees you get hit by something and then start dripping red, she growls and jumps at the assailant’s throat. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Show an Opportunity</strong></h4><p>Reactions are all about having stuff happen that will <strong>change the situation</strong> and move events along. <em>Showing an Opportunity</em> allows the World to lead Protagonists towards an interesting direction without forcing their hand, or avoid a situation from stalling, or present juicy hard choices. It is a direct expression of <em>Being a Fan</em>.</p><p>Some opportunities might have a <strong>catch</strong> of some kind: \"<em>here is an opportunity <strong>but</strong>...\"</em>. Be honest and forthcoming about it. An informed hard choice is always better than a startling sucker punch. At times the Players might consider your imagined catch as trivial, but this is not a problem. Make a note of this to help you learn what the PCs/Players care about or not, what makes them tick, what engages them.</p><p>Not all opportunities need to have a catch. Instead, they can provide an easy way out, a moment of respite, a tempting chance. These things are incredibly <strong>valuable to the World</strong>, helping you get out of three common problematic situations:</p><ul><li>The Players are stuck or cornered, with little idea of what to do next.</li><li>A tense situation, often a fight or a chase, drags on too long, losing steam and interest.</li><li>A long string of bad rolls makes it difficult for the World to come up with reasonable or interesting negative outcomes.</li></ul><p>In all these cases, showing an opportunity is <strong>your</strong> easy way out, seamlessly and elegantly pushing things forward without feeling unpleasant for the Players. No cheating to save them, no railroading to force them; just <em>Show them an opportunity</em> and let them make their choices.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - The stone golem is beating you badly while your weapons clink on its rock-hard skin, ineffective.

But while fighting its position has shifted a bit away from the door, which is now unobstructed<em><strong>.</strong></em> <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - The guards seem hostile, but from what you’ve gathered of the situation you think that by snitching on the farmer’s hiding place the guards might be persuaded to let you go. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - The guards’ chieftain says “<em>Tell us where the farmer is hiding and we’ll let you go... or we’ll arrest you in his stead.</em>” <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Player</strong> - Evart raises his hands in defeat: “<em>And how are we supposed to get the Jade Monkey? We’re stuck!</em>”</p><p><strong>World</strong> - Maybe the merchant near the river could help? You remember how his stall was full of precious gems and little statues, and how he seemed to conduct himself in a very shady way. <em>What do you do?</em></p></td><td><p><strong>Player</strong> - Evart raises his hands in defeat: “<em>And how are we supposed to get the Jade Monkey? We’re stuck!</em>”</p><p><strong>World</strong> - While debating what to do, you hear a knocking at the door. It’s a child that, with a face both very serious and cute, says: “<em>My master has heard of your predicament and would like to make you an offer. Please follow me.</em>” <em>What do you do?</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Reveal an Unwelcome Truth</strong></h4><p>When the Protagonists try to acquire information and something triggers a <em>World Reaction</em>, you should always give them bad news rather than no news. They “succeed” but what they get is not what they expected or hoped for. Or, as a consequence of <strong>any kind of action</strong>, your Reaction can be to suddenly reveal a startling or problematic detail. In any case, when revealing new info about something, consider if it could be expressed as a Tag. If so, write it down and communicate it to the Protagonists.</p><p>Whether <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Closed</strong>, an unwelcome truth is always unwelcome. But an <strong>Open</strong> unwelcome truth is just hearsay, gossip, a possibility to be confirmed, or maybe something vague that still needs clarification. This means that future play events might reveal the “final truth” to be different than initially revealed or expected. Conversely, a <strong>Closed</strong> unwelcome truth is a proven fact.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - Yes, you remember the arcane formula to open the portal, but it requires some kind of cost or sacrifice that you are not sure about. Using the wrong one could have unexpected effects. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Yes, you easily remember the arcane formula to open the portal, but it requires the willing sacrifice of one’s eye. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - You remember stories about the regenerative powers of this kind of creature. Your blade might not be enough to see you through a confrontation. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You slash at the creature and see its blood spray high, the flesh rent and the bone broken. But an instant later you also see it heal back as if nothing had happened. Only a thin black line to show where you cut it. The creature smiles at you with malevolence. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - Yes, you manage to stalk the assassin and catch a glimpse of the face under the hood. It looks like a young woman. Is she your friend’s daughter? You can’t yet tell for sure. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Yes, you reach the assassin, pull them to the ground, and tear the hood away from their face revealing... a young woman who you recognise. She’s your friend’s daughter! <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Take Away Their People</strong></h4><p>This Reaction can be used literally, allowing NPCs to <strong>capture</strong> someone. But it can also be used more subtly by somehow <strong>preventing cooperation</strong> between characters, maybe because they can’t see or hear their allies, or because something <strong>separates</strong> them (distance, crowds, doors, time, etc).</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - If you hold position here, no creature will get through, but in the commotion, Amara might be dragged away into the treeline. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You hold position and no creature gets through, but in the commotion, Amara is dragged away into the treeline. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - The plaza is so full of people that, once you get into it, you and Cartig might be unable to communicate clearly over the din of merchants and traffic. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Wait, the plaza is so full of people that you and Cartig are unable to hear each other over the din of merchants and traffic. <em>What do you do instead?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - If you go back now Darlon might not be there, probably still out hunting. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - The place is deserted. Darlon must still be out hunting. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Take Away Their Stuff</strong></h4><p>You can use this Reaction to give weight and meaning to <strong>the passing of time</strong> by describing how some item or resource gets depleted, used up, or consumed. Torches, food, special ammunition are all good candidates. You can introduce a <strong>new problematic element</strong> by describing how something steals or ruins equipment and Supplies.</p><blockquote><p>Pests eating or fouling rations, street urchins pickpocketing valuables, creatures reacting badly to some item's smell or presence.</p></blockquote><p>You can give relevance to <strong>the environment</strong> by describing how the Protagonists need to sacrifice something in order to survive/traverse the world around them, or how an external condition makes some of their equipment temporarily unusable.</p><blockquote><p>Dampness might make torches useless, flammable gases or dust in the air might make torches dangerous, thick vegetation might make big weapons unwieldy and mounts or vehicles useless and problematic.</p></blockquote><p>A more direct and proactive option is also to describe some NPC or environmental condition literally <strong>taking</strong> something from the Protagonists. A skilled opponent might disarm them, a careless action might make them lose grip on an important item, etc. Or more figuratively, something could take away their <strong>sight</strong> (darkness, sand in the eyes, a sudden flash), their <strong>hearing</strong> (a noisy crowd, a nearby explosion, a violent ear-slap), their <strong>balance</strong>, or anything else you can imagine could be “taken” from them <strong>given the fictional circumstances</strong>.</p><p>In any of the previous cases, you can decide that the fictional situation also translates into a mechanical consequence, be it reducing the level of Supplies of any affected Protagonist, losing access to a Tag, or imposing a new one.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - Yes, you can wait throughout the night, but it’ll cost you a bunch of torches (and a level of Supplies). <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You’ve waited through the night and it has cost you quite a few torches. Lower your Supplies. Now, <em>what do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - You recognize these mushrooms. If you camp here, they will surely invade your food rations, ruining a level of Supplies. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Your food rations have been ruined by toxic mushrooms.

Apply the move outcome as if you were a Player maneuvering their Protagonist, asking and answering as needed. In so doing, keep a few critical points in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Never</strong> freestyle new mechanical effects to represent a “turned” move. If you can’t <strong>easily</strong> <em>Turn their move back on them</em> in the manner explained above, <strong>then just don’t</strong>.</li><li><strong>Never</strong> use this Reaction to \"turn\" the <em><strong>Brawl</strong></em> move back on an acting PC.</li><li>Remember the rules about <strong>Dis/Advantage</strong> applied to NPCs, as explained in section 3 of chapter 2.</li><li><p>If the only effect of the move is to grant info to the NPC, have them <strong>immediately act</strong> on it.</p></li></ul><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - You observe the angry crowd (<em><strong>Look Around</strong></em>) but you notice some of them trying to have a good look at you too. <em>What do you do about it?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You observe the angry crowd (<em><strong>Look Around</strong></em>) but the crowd scrutinises you too! Who among your group is the most vulnerable in this situation? And what is the best way past you and your allies?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - You point your sword at the sailor’s throat (<em><strong>Threaten</strong></em>) but in doing so you notice her trying to slip a knife near your private parts. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You point your sword at the sailor’s throat (<em><strong>Threaten</strong></em>) but then you feel pressure near your private parts. As you realise where her knife is pointing, she says “<em>Drop YOUR weapon, or else!</em>” Do you cave, or force her hand?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - Maybe you know something about goblins (<em><strong>Recall Lore</strong></em>) but surely goblins know a lot about your people and they seem to be on the verge of doing something that you don’t believe would be pleasant.<em> What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Maybe you know something about goblins (<em><strong>Recall Lore</strong></em>) but surely goblins know a lot about your people. Say, what kind of insult would make a person of your Blood or Kin go absolutely nuts? Ah... interesting... that is exactly what the goblins start chanting! <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Inflict Harm</strong></h4><p>This Reaction lets you describe something that can cause harm to <strong>one or more</strong> characters, be they PCs or NPCs. To do so you never just state a level of harm (<em>Calladan takes <strong>Serious</strong> harm</em>) but instead:</p><ol><li>Describe a fictional action, event, or situation you think could cause harm.</li><li>Openly follow the procedures for harm adjudication (chapter 2 section 5).</li><li><p>Have each victim of harm choose and apply its effects.</p><ol><li>The Players do it for their PCs.</li><li><p>The World does it for their NPCs.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>Inflicting harm on a Protagonist is a common option, but far from the only one available to you.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Make violence indiscriminate</strong><br />Players <strong>expect</strong> the World to damage their Protagonists, and are somewhat ready for it. Instead, try to often hurt their friends and allies, hurt innocent bystanders, hurt the land and the buildings and the objects around them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make violence matter</strong><br />Players <strong>expect</strong> everyone to select the tamest harm effects when given the chance. When PCs suffer harm, this is their prerogative. But when NPCs suffer harm, you decide: show that there is no such thing as “<em>moderate</em>” violence by having the NPCs faint, bleed, vomit, cry ... <strong>ruin</strong> them.</p></li></ul><p>Proper use of this Reaction touches on many Principles and Agendas.</p><ul><li><em>Kill Your Darlings Mercilessly</em> to shock Players out of complacency, using NPCs to show what could happen to their PCs if they are not careful.</li><li><em>Kill Your Darlings Mercilessly</em> to reward Players for their efforts and to <em>Be a Fan</em> of their Protagonists, felling NPCs when it is the most fun and appropriate, instead of dragging the action into endless attrition.</li><li><em>Make Sense</em> by showing the consequences of dangerous actions.</li><li><em>Be a Fan</em> by hurting the Protagonists and the people they care about enough to make life challenging.</li><li><p><em>Be a Fan</em> by refraining from hurting them without a fair warning and a chance to intervene.</p></li></ul><p>Inflicting harm can often mean something different than broken bones and bloodstains. Think about inflicting harm of a social nature, or mental, spiritual, metaphysical, etc. Do this by creating and assigning Tags such as <em><strong>[bad reputation]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[brokenhearted]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[unstuck in time]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[addicted to giggleberries]</strong></em>. This is also a very effective way to handle damage suffered by places, structures, and items.</p><p>“<strong>Old</strong>” harm can also be leveraged to great effect. You could inflict <strong>new</strong> harm by describing how previous effects are getting <strong>worse</strong>: describe what this worsened state looks and feels like, then adjudicate harm as usual. Or you could avoid new harm and instead use a different Reaction to simply <em>Highlight a Downside</em> of their wounds and ailments, or anyway leverage a current harm effect as fictional positioning to justify other interesting Reactions.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - You notice an archer pointing their bow at Timo, the guide you hired. They are about to let the arrow fly. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Timo, the guide you hired, sits down with a heavy thump, an arrow protruding from his chest. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Player</strong> - I jump onto the next roof.</p><p><strong>World</strong> - Ok, you are aware that the strain might <strong>Seriously</strong> mess with your recent wound. What do you do?</p></td><td><p><strong>World</strong> - You jump to the next roof but, upon landing, you feel a terrible pain in your side, your shirt quickly reddening. Yesterday’s wound must have ripped open and now <strong>Seriously </strong>hurts.</p><p><strong>Player</strong> - Damn! Being all bloody and shaky I guess I now <em><strong>look like a mess</strong></em> [<strong>Temp</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>effect]. And yeah, the pain <em><strong>impedes</strong></em> me actively [<strong>Serious</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>effect].</p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - These marauders don’t seem like the sophisticated type. Using words instead of violence might be seen as weakness. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - The marauders laugh at your speech but in doing so they also seem to abandon their hostile intentions. Afterward, though, you hear them calling you <em><strong>[Sir Big Mouth]</strong></em> behind your back.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Put them at a Disadvantage</strong></h4><p>Just like inflicting harm requires you to describe an action or event which <strong>explicitly</strong> causes the harm that will be suffered, this Reaction also requires you to first and foremost describe actions, events, and circumstances that <strong>obviously</strong> cause the Disadvantage that will hinder the Protagonists. Always offer <strong>a clear source</strong> for the Disadvantage, as it is an easy way to offer meaningful and sometimes hard choices without much effort on your part.</p><p><strong>Never</strong> say “<em>you get Disadvantage</em>”.</p><p><strong>Always</strong> say something like “<em>The wind is devilishly strong, it might make things difficult</em>” and then if the PCs ignore it “<em>So you do it anyway? Cool, but now you are at a Disadvantage</em>”.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Open Examples</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>Closed Examples</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - A storm is raging outside. Following the tracks of the beast will not be easy and may put you at a Disadvantage. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Following the trail of the beast in the middle of the storm is not easy. You manage to do it, but with Disadvantage.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - Ramovar is very skilled and in an honest duel you would be at a Disadvantage. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - Dueling with Ramovar, you realize his remarkable skill. You are at an obvious Disadvantage. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>World</strong> - It is clear that you could make yourself understood but, not speaking the language well, you would be at a Disadvantage in a debate. <em>What do you do?</em></td><td><strong>World</strong> - You are making yourself more or less understood but, not speaking the language well, you often stumble into mistakes and misunderstandings that put you at a Disadvantage. <em>What do you do?</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>React as an Agent</strong></h4><p>Every typology of Agent (chapter 4 section 5) is associated with a unique list of Reactions specifically designed to express and showcase the Agent’s unique features and behaviors.</p><p>Agent Reactions tend to be <strong>more specific variations</strong> of normal World Reactions expressed in the form of a fictional effect, action, or situation, like “<em>Someone withdraws and seeks isolation</em>”. As usual, the Reaction text is meant to both <strong>inspire</strong> and <strong>limit</strong>, guiding you in interpreting it in the way that best fits the fictional situation you are reacting to.</p><p>Don’t try to memorise all the possible Agent Reactions. Instead, make a habit of doing as you already do for the normal <em>World Reactions</em>: quickly <strong>browsing the list</strong> of Reactions to see if anything catches your eye.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Using Tags</strong></h3><p>Fictional Tags (chapter 2 section 2) are a powerful and versatile tool in the World’s hands. They are useful both in handling PCs and NPCs, but also all other sorts of things including Agents, as we’ll soon see.</p><p>The harm system is pretty much a highly structured and very specific Tag architecture. By using Tags to represent non-standard effects and statuses, you can effortlessly cover most situations in a way that is still compatible with the overall rules: thus a character could be tagged as being <em>[poisoned]</em> or as being afflicted by the <em>[green Pox]</em>, or as being <em><strong>[starving]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[freezing]</strong></em>. Positive Tags are possible too, highlighting how a character is <em><strong>[blessed]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[chosen]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[in love]</strong></em>.</p><p>Tags can be used to make a character’s reputation more substantial. Being <em><strong>[feared]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[beloved]</strong></em> or a <em><strong>[drunken fool]</strong></em> will see the NPCs behave in a way that reflects that reputation. Being considered a <em><strong>[snitch]</strong></em> rather than <em><strong>[trustworthy]</strong></em> can have very concrete in-game consequences,etc.</p><h4><strong>Steadings</strong></h4><p>Tags can be improvised on the fly, or they can be prepared beforehand in order to have them represent a specific group of things the World deems useful to have at the ready. Some Equipment Tags follow this principle, and <em>Steadings</em> are another example.</p><p>A Steading is a community of people organized in some form of orderly civilization, which is a thing the World often has to deal with in handling the emergent game setting. Some elements that are commonly useful to define are:</p><p>The main Tag, representing the overall size:</p><ul><li><em><strong>[hamlet]</strong></em> - a settlement of just a few houses sharing and bartering their few resources.</li><li><em><strong>[village]</strong></em> - a small and close-knit community with limited resources and services.</li><li><em><strong>[town]</strong></em> - a medium-sized <em>know-by-sight</em> community with basic trade and a simple economy.</li><li><em><strong>[city]</strong></em> - a big and loose community with inner sub-groups, decent traffic, and trade.</li><li><em><strong>[capital]</strong></em> or <em><strong>[metropolis]</strong></em> - a sprawling center of population and activity made up of distinct areas, full of traffic and opportunities.</li></ul><p>Additional Tags could go deeper into describing specific characteristics of a Steading:</p><ul><li>Its level of <strong>prosperity</strong> <em><strong>[scanty, poor, moderate, wealthy].</strong></em></li><li>The state of its <strong>population</strong> <em><strong>[collapsing, shrinking, growing, booming].</strong></em></li><li>Its <strong>military</strong> capabilities <em><strong>[militians, soldiers, watch, army].</strong></em></li><li>Any number of <strong>other</strong> interesting details <em><strong>[elven, historical, lawless, safe, etc.].</strong></em></li></ul><hr /><h2><strong>4.5 - Prep &amp; Agents</strong></h2><p>What happens in <em>Fantasy World</em> between the first and second sessions, and then again between all the following sessions, is called preparation or just “<strong>prep</strong>”. Beware that this prep work is radically different from the classic concept of “<em>planning a campaign</em>” or even that of “<em>preparing an adventure</em>”.</p><p>Do <strong>not</strong> pre-plan a story.</p><p>Do <strong>not</strong> pre-arrange a series of encounters.</p><p>Instead, what you do in order to <em>Play to Find Out</em> is to use all the notes and ideas produced at the table in previous sessions, add your own ideas and questions, and organize it all in such a way as to create a <strong>dynamic and unstable situation</strong> surrounding the Protagonists.</p><p>The main tools for this job are the <strong>Agents Map</strong> and all the various Agents you will note on it.</p><h3><strong>What is an Agent?</strong></h3><p>An Agent is a tool, something or someone that the World uses to depict an environment that <em>Makes Sense</em>, to <em>Rock the Boat</em> by shaking things up, and bring a specific <strong>theme</strong> to the fore.</p><p>An Agent is <strong>not</strong> necessarily adverse or dangerous to the Protagonists. An Agent <strong>acts</strong> of its own accord and volition, out of the Protagonists’ control. That’s all it is and all it does. Sometimes it will provide help and opportunities. Sometimes it will provide opposition and adversity. Sometimes it will just shift things around in a way that isn’t obviously good or bad.</p><p>There are three critical concepts to the creation and use of Agents:</p><ul><li>Everything is an Agent.</li><li>Everything is People.</li><li>Everything is Prep.</li></ul><h4><strong>Everything is an Agent</strong></h4><p>An Agent is <strong>everything</strong> and <strong>everyone</strong> that is interesting and relevant in the world surrounding the Protagonists.</p><p>The <strong>people</strong> they meet. Their enemies, sure. But also the folks in a village, a memorable barkeep, a named beggar, a dashing traveler. And the PCs’ companions and allies too! The Wayfarer’s animal, the Occultist’s familiar, any henchmen, helper, or follower. A Protagonist’s friends and family, that one-night lover, the old battle comrade.</p><p>The <strong>creatures</strong> they encounter. The animals living in a wild area, the monsters lurking in the dark, the inhabitants of the deep sea, that strange flower that grows everywhere in this region.</p><p>The <strong>places</strong> they visit. The ancient ruins they are exploring, the silent forest they are journeying through, the big city that lies to the west, the creepy house on the hill, the surreal palace hidden at the heart of the swamp.</p><p>The <strong>items</strong> they find. A magical sword, a cursed ring, an arcane tome, an infamous ship, a legendary map; any item that <strong>could make things happen around it</strong>, either because it is the focus of desires and plots, or because of unique characteristics both magical and mundane.</p><h4><strong>Everything is People</strong></h4><p>The easiest and most effective way to create and manage Agents that <strong>make sense</strong> and feel memorable, is to handle <strong>everything</strong> as if it were people. And when you do, stick to <strong>portraying </strong><em><strong>Simple People</strong></em> (chapter 4 section 3): find a striking physical feature and use it as a guide to formulate a simple and straightforward motivation.</p><p>Treat animals, monsters, and other living creatures as people.</p><p>Treat places, items, and even environmental conditions (such as a plague or a storm) as if they were people.</p><p>If something is relevant enough to become an Agent and appear on the Agents Map, then <strong>it is people</strong>: it has needs and desires, it has behaviors and attitudes, it takes actions according to them, and because you always portray <em>Simple People,</em> these elements are (at least in the World’s eyes) <strong>simple and straightforward</strong> too.</p><blockquote><p>Creatures are People</p><p>A giant black spider sports a streak of white hair that looks a bit like a punk mohawk. When you then wonder how to play and React as the spider, you can just think \"what would a punk look and behave like?\"</p><p>Places are People</p><p>A river has big curves and slow waters that make you think of the round belly of a jolly fat man. When you then wonder how to play and React as the river, you can just think \"what would a jolly fat man look and behave like?\"</p><p>Items are People</p><p>A mundane and 100% not-magical jewelry box is for some reason interesting enough to be developed into an Agent. You look for a striking feature and decide that it has a lid that is a bit broken and jagged, and that this makes you think of teeth, like those of an animal.</p><p>But you need a person!</p><p>So, to what kind of person could those animalistic teeth belong? An aggressive person, baring their teeth in anger? A sinister person, grinning in a creepy way? A happy simpleton, flashing a craggy smile without realising how menacing it could look?</p><p>Whatever your choice, when you then wonder how to play and React as the jewelry box, you can just think \"what would that person look and behave like?\"</p></blockquote><h4><strong>To Agent or not to Agent?</strong></h4><p>Every \"thing\" in the game that gets described at the table is, with the exception of the Protagonists themselves, part of the World's prep: people, beasts, places, items, etc.</p><p>In most cases, such entities only exist in the form of a passing mention. Then the more they become <strong>interesting</strong>, <strong>important</strong>, or even just <strong>recurring</strong>, the more they acquire substance and detail. The World will simply jot down these details for the sake of remembering them: a proper name, a \"body\" part characterizing and leading them, maybe a brief description of their appearance, their role, or their relation to something else-whatever helps the World know what to say when the entity enters a scene, interacts with the Protagonists, or is supposed to do something off-screen.</p><p>If the World feels that these simple notes are enough, then they are. All prep exists as a way to help the World organize ideas and info to use in active play. Nothing more.</p><p>So while everything <strong>can</strong> be an Agent, not everything <strong>has to</strong> be an Agent. Not immediately, at least.</p><p>Agents can be created <strong>from the bottom up</strong> when the World deems that something in their prep is growing into a blob of notes and details. Applying the Agent structure to this blob is a way to better organize the available info, making it clearer and more usable.</p><p>Agents can be created <strong>from the top down</strong> when the World needs something in their prep to immediately have a certain space and importance in the game. Applying the Agent structure to their raw ideas guides the World through some important questions and choices, shaping the new “thing” into a more defined and tangible game element.</p><p>Agents can also <strong>change</strong>, as they are simply an agglomerate of notes and ideas and details. They can and should be routinely <strong>updated</strong> as the game goes on. The World always has to <strong>say</strong> what <em>Prep</em> and <em>Honesty</em> demand (chapter 4 section 2), but this still leaves plenty of room for Agents to evolve, grow, shrink, or simply be abandoned because along the way the World felt like bringing some different ideas to the table. In the end, Agents are, like everything else in this chapter, a <strong>structure</strong> that the game uses to help the World organize their notes and ideas.</p><blockquote><p>At first, the World mentions the existence of a local bounty hunter. It's a throwaway detail of no importance.</p><p>When the group meets this person, or when they express the will to meet them, the World decides that she is a woman, that her name is Karis, and that her leading body parts are her agile and ever-moving fingers.</p><p>This seems to be enough for a while. But then the World decides that Karis should be defined as an Agent. This gives her (as explained in the following section) a Type, an Impulse, a list of Reactions, maybe some Fate questions, maybe a Cast, etc.</p><p>Later on, the World feels like updating Karis' Agent profile. Maybe the initial idea seemed cool on paper but felt wrong or unwieldy in play. Maybe game events suggest a change or evolution of the character and her situation.</p><p>The Players might never know about these technical changes, as they are not privy to the World's notes and prep. The only thing they \"see\" are the changes in how Karis is portrayed by the World.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Secrecy vs Privacy</strong></p><p>Prep is meant to be kept private, but not secret.</p><p>Private, because by <em>Draping the Rules in Fiction</em> the World's notes will not be visible to the Players. To the Protagonists, an NPC (like <em>Karis</em>, the bounty hunter from the previous example) is just a person they meet.</p><p>But there is no need for secrecy. If the Players do happen to see the World's notes it won't be a big deal. Knowing that Karis is a basic named NPC rather than a more fleshed-out Agent makes no difference whatsoever. Knowing that her Type is <strong>Power</strong> rather than <strong>Freak</strong>, or that her main <strong>Fate</strong> is about her social status rather than her love life, are more telling details, but none of them will mean anything relevant, as the World might bring them into play in ways that defy the Players’ expectations. Or not! The game won't be ruined anyway. Nothing of relevance will be spoiled.<br />As everyone <strong>plays to find out</strong>, there are no future events set in stone. Even seeing the details of currently active Hourglasses won't be a real problem, as they simply organize <strong>possible</strong> future events that the World <strong>should have already communicated</strong> as being on the horizon.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Creating an Agent</strong></h3><p>To create an Agent of any kind you need to:</p><ol><li>Give a <strong>NAME</strong> to the Agent, then describe it.</li><li>If it has a <strong>CAST</strong>, list it.</li><li>Choose a <strong>TYPE</strong> and copy over its <strong>IMPULSE.</strong></li><li>If it has <strong>CONNECTIONS</strong> to other Agents, list them.</li><li>If you have <strong>FATE</strong> questions, list them.</li><li>If it calls for an <strong>HOURGLASS</strong>, create it.</li><li>Place it on the <strong>Agents Map</strong> and, if it’s in motion, mark its direction with an arrow.</li></ol><h4><strong>1 - Name &amp; Description</strong></h4><p>Find a name you can remember easily, then write a quick sentence describing the Agent.</p><h4><strong>2 - Cast</strong></h4><p>If the Agent is made up of many elements, list them here. They are important enough to have a name and be listed here, but not relevant enough (yet) to be a whole Agent of their own. They could be the most notable faces within a village, the many places and areas that are part of a bigger landscape, or a few important items that stand out among the other possessions of an Agent.</p><h4><strong>3 - Type, Subtype &amp; Impulse</strong></h4><p>Once you have an idea of what an Agent is and what it looks like you can identify its Type. To do so you need to think about <strong>the one important thing</strong> this Agent should represent.</p><p>The same Agent could reasonably fit multiple Types, so a choice has to be made. Always pick just one Type, the one that most interests you at the moment. Later in the game, when you review and update the Agents Map and its elements, it is ok to change an Agent’s Type to fit the current and evolving circumstances. The five available Types are:</p><ul><li>Affliction</li><li>Brutes</li><li>Freak</li><li>Landscape</li><li>Power</li></ul><p>Each Agent is then put into focus by selecting one out of six available Subtypes that are specific to each different Type. Every Subtype is also linked to a unique Impulse. This structure helps the World to organize and then use all the Agents that will play a role in the story, decide which ones to use, how they will behave, and why.</p><p>Lastly, each Type of Agent offers a shortlist of Agent Reactions.</p><p>They work exactly like the more general <em>World Reactions</em>, but are simpler and more direct, often expressing a straightforward “<em>this thing happens</em>”. Use them to bring the Agent to the fore and to showcase their unique characteristics.</p><hr /><p><strong>Affliction</strong></p><p>This Agent represents <strong>the actions people take</strong> because they are exposed to something bad that afflicts them. Different afflictions push people to behave in different ways, so ask yourself: how has <strong>the Affliction</strong> changed people’s lives? What are they pushed to do? How do they feel about it? How do their actions change the world around them? Is there a way out or back?</p><p><em>Choose one Subtype of Affliction:</em></p><ul><li>Barrier | Impulse to isolate and impoverish.</li><li>Belief | Impulse to control choices and actions.</li><li>Disease | Impulse to expand and saturate.</li><li>Hardship | Impulse to expose people to danger.</li><li>Sacrifice | Impulse to leave people bereft.</li><li>Tradition | Impulse to promote and justify violence.</li></ul><p><em>Agent Reactions:</em></p><p>Someone...</p><ul><li>... neglects duties, responsibilities, obligations.</li><li>... flies into a rage.</li><li>... takes self-destructive, fruitless, or hopeless action.</li><li>... approaches, seeking help or comfort</li><li>... withdraws, seeking isolation</li><li>... proclaims the Affliction to be a deserved punishment</li><li>... proclaims the Affliction to be, in truth, a blessing</li><li>... refuses or fails to adapt to new circumstances</li><li>... brings friends or loved ones along</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Brutes</strong></p><p>This Agent represents a <strong>group of people</strong>, with or without a leader, acting in concert. What you define here is the <strong>group’s Impulse</strong>, how people behave as part of a mob/pack/swarm, but individuals within the group might not share its Impulse and might even fight against it.</p><p><em>Choose one Subtype of Brutes:</em></p><ul><li>Cult | Impulse to incorporate people.</li><li>Enforcers | Impulse to victimize who stands out.</li><li>Family | Impulse to close ranks, protect their own.</li><li>Hedonists | Impulse to consume resources.</li><li>Hunter Pack | impulse to victimize anyone vulnerable.</li><li>Mob | Impulse to riot, burn, kill scapegoats.</li></ul><p><em>Agent Reactions:</em></p><p>The group...</p><ul><li>... bursts out in uncoordinated, undirected violence.</li><li>... takes coordinated action with a coherent objective.</li><li>... tells stories (truth, lies, allegories, homilies).</li><li>... demands consideration or indulgence.</li><li>... rigidly follows or defies authority.</li><li>... clings to or defies reason.</li><li>... makes a show of solidarity and power.</li><li>... asks for help or for someone’s participation.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Power</strong></p><p>This Agent represents a person that acts primarily <strong>through other people</strong>, be it through direct control and command or through subtle influence and maneuvering. Use Powers to portray strong individuals at the heart of big and small groups, institutions, and networks. A queen, a gang leader, a well-connected innkeeper, an ambitious villager.</p><p><em>Choose one Subtype of Power:</em></p><ul><li>Alpha | Impulse to hunt and dominate.</li><li>Collector | Impulse to own and acquire.</li><li>Conqueror | Impulse to consume and overrun.</li><li>Dictator | Impulse to control and organize.</li><li>Prophet | Impulse to denounce and overthrow.</li><li>Slaver | Impulse to own and sell people.</li></ul><p><em>Agent Reactions:</em></p><p>The power uses someone else to...</p><ul><li>... outflank, corner or encircle someone.</li><li>... attack someone suddenly, directly, and very hard.</li><li>... attack someone cautiously, holding reserves.</li><li>... seize someone/thing for leverage or information.</li><li>... make a show of force or discipline.</li><li>... negotiate or demand obedience.</li><li>... claim territory: move into it, blockade it, assault it.</li><li>... buy out someone’s allies.</li><li>... attack someone where they’re weak.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Freak</strong></p><p>This Agent represents someone or something <strong>out of the ordinary</strong>. A very talented person, a particularly ferocious beast, a patch of barren land, a book about a disturbing or forbidden subject. Use Freaks to <strong>highlight a</strong> <strong>different point of view</strong>, its origins, its relationship with the surrounding “normal”, to face the PCs with an “other”.</p><p><em>Choose one Subtype of Freak:</em></p><ul><li>Abomination | Impulse to bring chaos and ruin.</li><li>Devourer | Impulse to feed and to have more.</li><li>Disease | Impulse to touch, invade, be intimate.</li><li>Fiend | Impulse to feel or inflict pain.</li><li>Portent | Impulse to excel, to be above others.</li><li>Victim | Impulse to seek reparation or retribution.</li></ul><p><em>Agent Reactions:</em></p><p>The freak...</p><ul><li>... shows the nature of the world it inhabits.</li><li>... shows the contents of its heart.</li><li>... appears as part of someone’s day, life, or path.</li><li>... ruins, befouls, rots, desecrates, corrupts something.</li><li>... takes away or threatens something cherished.</li><li>... insults, offends, or provokes someone.</li><li>... attacks someone stealthily.</li><li>... lashes out, head-on, without threat or warning.</li><li>... offers a service, with strings attached.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Landscape</strong></p><p>This Agent represents how <strong>the environment itself</strong> can be a character in a story. A Landscape can be natural or constructed, vast or small. The lands of <em>Ansalon</em>, the spider forest, the ruins of <em>Kal’taher</em>, the city of <em>Brittlewood</em>, the sewers, the market, the house on the hill, a dungeon.</p><p><em>Choose one Subtype of Landscape:</em></p><ul><li>Breeding Pit | Impulse to generate badness.</li><li>Fortress | Impulse to deny access.</li><li>Furnace | Impulse to consume things.</li><li>Maze | Impulse to discourage passage and to entrap.</li><li>Mirage | Impulse to entice and betray.</li><li>Prison | Impulse to contain and deny release.</li></ul><p><em>Agent Reactions:</em></p><p>The environment...</p><ul><li>... presents difficult or dangerous terrain.</li><li>... bars or opens the way.</li><li>... reveals a different path.</li><li>... shifts, moves, rearranges.</li><li>... presents a guide or a guardian.</li><li>... presents a predator or prey.</li><li>... disgorges something.</li><li>... shows a glimpse of beauty.</li><li>... shows a glimpse of savagery.</li></ul><hr /><h4><strong>4 - Connections</strong></h4><p>List here <strong>other</strong> Agents you consider closely related to this one. This helps you keep everything under control, and to remember which Agents might be present or relevant whenever something happens to one of their connections.</p><h4><strong>5 - Fate</strong></h4><p>The World <strong>must not pre-plan</strong> the future destiny of their Agents. You can instead express <strong>questions</strong> about uncertain outcomes you are curious about:</p><ul><li>Will this one NPC survive?</li><li>Will the blood stone be found?</li><li>Will this other NPC get home in time?</li><li>Will the village ask for help?</li><li>Will the army invade the western lands?</li></ul><p>Fate questions can be big or small in scope, regarding the future of a whole country or a single NPC, but they must <strong>never be trivial</strong>. The answer to a Fate question will bring change to the Agent, or the world around it, in a deep and important way. This is one way to <em>Ask Honest Questions</em>, taking the things you are the most interested in out of your hands, allowing you to <em>Play to Find Out</em>.</p><h4><strong>6 - Hourglasses</strong></h4><p>Another way for the World to bring their ideas to the table and explore what might happen <strong>without fixing future events</strong> is to attach an Hourglass to an Agent.</p><p>An Hourglass is a <strong>countdown</strong> with six positions. At each position, the World jots down a note on how the Agent, or a situation involving it, will behave and progress. It is also ok to leave some positions empty, to have events progress more slowly, or to leave room for future inspiration.</p><p>Hourglasses are both descriptive and prescriptive. <strong>Descriptive</strong>, because when something that you have noted happens in the fiction, then you must advance the relevant Hourglasses to the appropriate position. <strong>Prescriptive</strong>, because when a Reaction makes you advance an Hourglass to a new position, then you must also describe how the noted behavior or event happens in the fiction.</p><p>Be sure to <strong>only</strong> write down things that have to do with your Agents and how they change the world around them:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Never dictate PC actions</strong><br />“<em>Zoltan the Troubadour sings in the plaza in front of the king</em>”.</p></li><li><p><strong>Never depend on PC actions</strong><br />“<em>When Zoltan the Troubadour sings in the plaza, the king notices him</em>”.</p></li></ul><p>You might be tempted to use PC actions to trigger events, like “<em><strong>if Zoltan sings in the plaza then X happens”</strong></em>, but I strongly advise against this. If the event does not happen, you prepared stuff for nothing. And the fact that you have a specific outcome in mind <strong>will</strong> influence your play in a way that might make you \"push\" more than you should, stifling your ability to <em>Play to find out</em>. In a word, it's an unhealthy practice that can lead to bad game behaviors.</p><p>An Hourglass can be set up right at the moment of Agent creation, to help you visualize what you already know is going on, or it can be added later, as events unfold and the situation changes. Hourglasses are just a way for the World to organize their notes, so if something happens that changes the fiction enough to make an Hourglass no longer current or even needed, feel free to modify it or scratch it completely.</p><p><strong>Tracing and Using an Hourglass</strong></p><p>The simplest way to trace an Hourglass by hand is to draw two triangles, one pointing downward and one pointing upward, with their respective “pointing” vertices intersecting. Then run a straight vertical line down the middle, splitting it into two halves. This leaves you with a shape divided into six spaces. Check the pictures in the following example to get a clearer idea of the final result.</p><p>You can fill the spaces however you like, there is no fixed order, it’s just an evocative way to keep track of a six-step countdown in a fantasy game. I personally like to follow the imaginary movement of sand in the Hourglass, slowly filling it from bottom to top, with my six annotations being written beside it ordered accordingly, from bottom to top. But the only important thing is that you are clear on what comes first, second, third, etc.</p><p><strong>Example of Hourglass</strong></p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p>6 - PCs are officially regional outlaws</p><p>5 - PCs are officially local outlaws</p><p>4 - regional authorities start nosing around</p><p>3 - villagers pursue the PCs</p><p>2 - villagers are hostile</p><p>1 - villagers are resentful</p></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>Example Agent</p><p>Sharpleaf</p><p>Affliction - Tradition - Impulse to promote and justify violence</p><p>Sharpleaf is a small village of hunters in the Great Forest.

In a way, it is “just” a list of names, but its structure helps the World focus on what is important, the current situation, and where it might lead. It is, in a nutshell, one possible way to organize the World’s game notes.</p><p>World’s preparation work and campaign building are all about updating the <strong>Agents Map</strong> in the time between one session and the next. Think about the characters, places, and events of the last session; if needed, translate them into Agents and position them on the map. Go over what was already on the map: should the Agents be moved? Changed? Evolved? Destroyed? Should they slowly fade out of the map as their relevance diminishes? Or could they make a comeback because of recent events? Could they turn into something different?</p><p>Truth be told, you do this work in the actual Agent notes. But the Map can help you visualize them all in one place, arranged in meaningful positions. Speaking of which...</p><p><strong>The Ring Structure</strong></p><p>The Agents Map has a central space meant for the Protagonists and all the Agents that are currently <strong>here</strong> with them either in a geographical sense (the Agent is at the PCs’ location or in the general area) or in a dramatic sense (the Agent is “closely” influencing the PCs), whichever meaning better serves your current organization.</p><p>The ring surrounding the center is where the World writes Agents that are <strong>closer</strong> to the PCs. The ring surrounding that area is where the <strong>farther</strong> Agents go. Both of these serve the same purpose as the central ring, just offering the World more space to move things around in an expressive way and avoid amassing everything in the same small location.</p><p>Finally, the most external ring is where the <strong>whispered</strong> Agents go, meaning all the Agents that still only exist as rumours and ideas. These can often be just names that the World has not yet bothered turning into real, fully-written Agents because they are still far away on the fictional horizon.</p><p>This all works by always keeping the Protagonists at the center of the map, with everything else moving all around relative to them.</p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Here</strong></td><td><strong>Closer</strong></td><td><strong>Farther</strong></td><td><strong>Whispered</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>Whispered</strong></em></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><em><strong>Farther</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>Closer</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>Here</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br />The map then offers additional “directions” that you can use to inform your choices when it comes to positioning Agents and moving them around:</p><ul><li>You have the <strong>North</strong>, <strong>South</strong>, <strong>West,</strong> and <strong>East</strong> directions. These are useful to represent relative geographical positioning more than anything else.</li><li>You have the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong> directions. These can describe physical positioning: high in the mountains, deep underground, flying in the sky, low in a valley, etc. Or social status: being rich or highborn, being poor or lowborn. Or any other concept that the World finds useful to arrange Agents on the map: it could be useful to position an Agent with a good reputation UP, and one with a bad one DOWN.</li><li><p>You have the <strong>In</strong> and <strong>Out</strong> directions. These are the most abstract and are used to position Agents according to how well-known / familiar / overt they are (<strong>In</strong>) or how obscure / alien / covert they are (<strong>Out</strong>). An Agent might be operating in the very same area where the PCs are (<strong>Here</strong>) but without them knowing about it (<strong>Out</strong>), or they might know about its existence but very little about its true nature and inner workings (<strong>Out</strong>). Conversely, an Agent might be somehow distant from the PCs (<strong>Farther</strong>) but they could be particularly familiar with it (<strong>In</strong>).</p></li></ul><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Here</strong></td><td><strong>Closer</strong></td><td><strong>Farther</strong></td><td><strong>Whispered</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><em><strong>IN</strong></em></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><em><strong>NORTH</strong></em></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><em><strong>UP</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><em><strong>IN</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>NORTH</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>UP</strong></em></td><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>IN</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>NORTH</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>UP</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>IN</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>NORTH</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>UP</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>WEST</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>WEST</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>WEST</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>WEST</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>EAST</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>EAST</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>EAST</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>EAST</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>DOWN</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>SOUTH</strong></em></td><td><em><strong>OUT</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td rowspan=\"3\"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>DOWN</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>SOUTH</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>OUT</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>DOWN</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>SOUTH</strong></em></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><em><strong>OUT</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>DOWN</strong></em></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><em><strong>SOUTH</strong></em></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p></p></td><td><em><strong>OUT</strong></em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br />Most of the time the World will reassess the scope and meaning of their Agents Map depending on what is the most useful for the game at a given time, often positioning Agents either in a geographical way <strong>or</strong> an abstract way. At a time when the PCs are traveling across a broad territory, it might be more useful to arrange Agents to offer a more geographical view of the situation. At a time when there is a lot going on in a specific location, be it a small town or a bustling city, it might be more valuable to position Agents according to their social standing, or other abstract factors. And even within the same context, immediate concerns could make some choices more useful than others and help make sense of seemingly conflicting positioning.</p><blockquote><p>The Cult of the Blue Feather is an Agent.</p><p>It mainly operates in a cluster of villages located high in the eastern mountains.</p><p>When the PCs are still far away from that region, the only relevant element might be that the Agent is Farther to the East.</p><p>When later on the PCs arrive in the region, it might be more useful to know that the Agent is Closer and Up in the mountains.</p><p>Once the PCs reach the cluster of villages it might make sense to position the Agent Here with the Protagonists and Out, because the cult is very reclusive and it's hard to know anything clear about it.</p><p>The Bromies street gang is an Agent.</p><p>The gang has its turf in the same town the PCs are currently located, so it might make sense to position the Agent Here.</p><p>But maybe the gang is currently just a vague idea in the World's mind, or just gossip the PCs have heard only a couple of times, so it could be positioned in the Whispered ring instead of uselessly crowding the central area.</p><p>Or maybe the Agent is real, known, and active, but the game events have veered in a direction that makes the gang an element that is not pressingly relevant, so it could be positioned Closer or even Farther to represent its conceptual distance, again leaving the central area of the map unclogged.</p></blockquote><p></p><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Here</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Closer</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Farther</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Whispered</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\" cke_show_border\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>IN</strong></td><td><strong>NORTH</strong></td><td><strong>UP</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>WEST</strong></td><td><p></p></td><td><strong>EAST</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>DOWN</strong></td><td><strong>SOUTH</strong></td><td><strong>OUT</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3><strong>Essential Agents</strong></h3><p>Right between the end of the first session and before the beginning of the second one, the World needs to create a short list of \"essential\" Agents:</p><ul><li>The place where the Protagonists are, make it a <strong>Landscape</strong>.</li><li>Every local population present there, make it an <strong>Affliction</strong>.</li><li>The people in each Protagonist’s life, make them <strong>Brutes</strong>, <strong>Freaks,</strong> or <strong>Powers</strong>. This means any friend, family member, enemy, debtor, etc., but also groups or social institutions.</li><li>For each Protagonist’s <strong>Issue</strong> and <strong>Doubt</strong>, find some thing/person/place that could become an Agent.</li></ul><p>Beware that you need to stick to the <strong>essentials</strong> here! Producing a long list of Agents is both useless and draining. This is not your job. Your job is to think hard about what is <strong>strictly relevant</strong> and turn those things into Agents. You have already played one session, so use that experience to guide your work.</p><p>Where are the story events taking place? Not the locations where the PCs came from, nor the place where they theoretically started the story but have already moved away from. Where are they playing <strong>now</strong>? Are they going to keep on playing there in the second session, or is it obvious that they will almost immediately move on to a different location? Because if that’s the case you might be better off shaping <strong>that place</strong> as an Agent.</p><p>Out of the many people in a Protagonist’s life, which ones are the few that will affect their actions and choices <strong>right now</strong>? Not those they left behind, nor those they have yet to meet, unless they are somehow acting to get back into the PC’s life, or affecting something the PC cares about enough to influence them <strong>here and now</strong>. Chances are, the list will count just a handful of individuals, and of those only one or two maybe would be worth turning into Agents at this time.</p><p>Issue and Doubt can be difficult to tie to something concrete, especially at the beginning. Having at least one Agent that could <strong>somehow tease and prod</strong> either the Issue or Doubt of a PC is enough to get things started.</p><p>These are the <strong>essentials</strong>. If you have time, energy, and ideas you can pour more work into defining game elements you think will most probably be actively used in the next session as Agents. But don’t overdo it - limit yourself to just a couple of things. You <strong>don’t</strong> need an NPC to be an Agent in order to play them in an engaging and effective way. Avoid wasting time on work that is not (yet) needed.</p><h4><strong>Between Sessions</strong></h4><p>Between each session and the next be sure to get out your Agents Map and look it over, <strong>asking yourself a bunch of questions</strong>. What has changed? Have any Agents come closer? Have any receded further into the distance? Should any whispers become more tangible? Have any Agents acted or reacted to the world outside the Protagonists' bounds?</p><p>Flip through your Agents and update them. Who was killed? Whose Fate questions found answers? Do you have new ones for them? How have their Hourglasses progressed?</p><p><strong>Create new Agents</strong> for the new notable people, groups, places, and things you’ve introduced in play. In doing so keep a few things in mind:</p><ul><li>Don't look for a <strong>story</strong>; Agents are all you need.</li><li>Keep your Agents <strong>simple</strong>; complex stories will naturally emerge from active play.</li><li>Don't hold back for a big reveal; don't breadcrumb events to have them last longer. All your Agents have <strong>impulses</strong> they should act on and <strong>body parts</strong> leading them around, so have them act whenever possible!</li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":250000,"name":"Fundamental Knowledge","type":"text","_id":"J4BRSYsp0CRqapjC","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2><strong>1.1 - Dramatic Fantasy</strong></h2><p>Fantasy World is a game that focuses on <strong>dramatic fantasy adventuring</strong>.</p><p>Dramatic fantasy is not about <em>soap opera melodrama among teen wizards</em>, although this could be a lot of fun- please someone make this game!</p><p>Dramatic fantasy is about the very <strong>personal conflicts</strong>, internal and external, that turn a bunch of drifting murderers into a group of heroes. It's about the consequences of their actions, and how they affect both the Protagonists and the world around them. It's about the tough choices and personal sacrifices and joys and sorrows and scars and hopes driving the Protagonists through their adventures. It's about the things that make you <strong>care</strong> about what happens.</p><p>When you don't care, something as epic as saving a kingdom could feel like a trivial and bothersome chore. When you do care, something as trivial as keeping a promise to a random village kid can feel epic and fulfilling.

Yes!</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Your First PbtA</p><p>Beginner Friendly</p><p>Deep &amp; Rich</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Fantasy World</strong></em> is a tabletop roleplaying game in the <em>PbtA</em> family.</p><p>If you're wondering what an RPG even is, worry not! I will explain all you need to know to go from zero to expert in the easiest way possible.</p><p>If you are a veteran roleplayer but are new to the ways of PbtA games, you're going to be fine too. I'll show you the lay of the land, the <strong>whys</strong> and <strong>hows</strong>, and all the juicy bits this kind of system has to offer.</p><p>And if you are well-versed in many different PbtA systems, I hope to pique your interest too. <em><strong>Fantasy World</strong></em> tosses out the window a few things that are considered standard (or even trending) in many PbtA games, turns unspoken guidelines into explicit procedures, and adds some original mechanics into the mix.</p><h3><strong>But, Why Fantasy World?</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Accessible</p><p>Clear</p><p>Practical</p></blockquote><p>Most <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse\" target=\"_blank\">Powered by the Apocalypse</a> games shine because of some amazing idea that sits at their core. But too often they also end up prioritizing style and novelty over clarity and practicality.</p><p>A common result is that the rule book alone is not enough to learn how to properly play, requiring previous expertise in PbtA systems to fully understand the game's inner workings.</p><p>Another common problem is the lack of clarity in how some mechanics work, leading to the need for on-the-fly negotiation and interpretation of things that should instead be unequivocal and straightforward. Moves are very susceptible to this.</p><p>This state of affairs prompted me to write a game that starts from a simple and familiar idea, <em>ye olde fantasy adventure</em>, and then focuses on being as <strong>user-friendly</strong> and <strong>pragmatic</strong> as possible.</p><p>My hope is to help people better understand other PbtA games too, how they are different, how they are similar, how they are brilliant and, sometimes, how they bump into problems. And to present a few ideas of my own, to try and push the envelope a bit further.</p><p>It might not be a veritable <em><strong>PbtA Next</strong></em>... but that's the general direction I'm aiming for.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><h3><strong>So... what is this game?</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Ye Olde Introduction</p><p>World &amp; Protagonist roles</p><p>Play Materials</p></blockquote><p><em>Fantasy World</em> is a game of narrative action, adventure, and exploration set in a <strong>fantastical world</strong> of your own devising.</p><p>It requires the presence of <strong>three to five</strong> participants.</p><p>One participant plays the role of <strong>World</strong>, while all others take on the role of <strong>Players</strong>. Both World and Players will act in the game through the lens of fictional characters specifically created for the purpose, referred to in this text as <em>Non Protagonist Characters</em> (<strong>NPCs</strong>) used by the World and as <em>Protagonist Characters</em> (<strong>PCs</strong>) used by the Players.</p><p>In <em>Fantasy World</em> there are no winners or losers, as the aim of the game is to experience together an engaging story of adventure. Characters may fail or succeed, die or prosper. No matter what befalls them, you \"win\" if the ensuing story moves ahead and entertains the people playing at the table.</p><p>To play you need to know these rules and to have a few items ready on hand:</p><ul><li>At least two six-sided dice (<strong>2d6</strong>), but two dice for each Player is more comfortable.</li><li>Some paper,pencils, and erasers.</li><li>A printout of the <strong>Common Moves Sheet</strong> (but one for each participant is better).</li><li>A printout of the <strong>World Sheet, Agent Map, </strong>and<strong> Agents Sheet.</strong></li><li>A printout of the <strong>Class</strong> <strong>Playbook</strong> each Player is going to use.</li><li>Some snacks and beverages.</li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>The Act of Playing</strong></h3><p>What you do at the table could be summarized as a <strong>conversation</strong>.</p><p>All participants go back and forth talking about their fictional characters immersed in some fictional situation, describing what they do, what they say, how they feel, and what it all looks like. Sometimes you talk over each other and interrupt one another, sometimes you wait for your turn to speak and allow space for others to express themselves, and in all cases, you <strong>listen and build on each others’ ideas</strong>.</p><p>This conversation becomes a game when you add rules to influence it. The rules define <strong>who can say something, when they can say it</strong>, and <strong>how it can be said</strong>. They also inject <strong>uncertainty and risk</strong> into what you say and ensure that important narrations have meaningful <strong>consequences</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Example</p><p>In general, each Player has the right and the responsibility to describe what their Protagonist says and does, while the World describes, well, the rest of the world around the Protagonists...</p><p>World - There's a shut window on the west wall.</p><p>Player - I open it. Outside I see a tall mountain and...</p><p>World - Err... no wait... you can only say what your PC does and says and thinks and feels. I am the World and it's up to me to say what your PC sees and hears and... what's in the world, you know?</p><p>Player - Oh, ok then, what do I see out the window?</p><p>World - Well, there actually is a mountain, why not? But it's far in the distance, to the west. It is day and...</p></blockquote><hr /><h3><strong>How Long it Takes to Play</strong></h3><blockquote><p>Game Sessions</p><p>Campaign Play</p><p>One-Shot Advice</p></blockquote><p><em>Fantasy World</em> has <strong>no definite end</strong>.</p><p>Usually you will play for one to three hours, which is a game <strong>session</strong>. Most likely you will have told an interesting and meaningful piece of a story, but not the whole of it. Thus you will keep building on it during future follow-up sessions. It is common to play one session every week, but many groups do it as often or as sparingly as they like and can.</p><p>Eventually you might reach the natural end of a story arc, or wrap up some loose ends and decide that this is where your adventure could end. This usually takes around ten sessions and is called a game <strong>campaign</strong>. Some campaigns could be shorter, others could take longer, and some can even string together several story arcs.</p><p>Because of this, I <strong>strongly advise</strong> gathering participants with space in their lives for this kind of commitment. Playing super-short campaigns is possible, even ones that explore a complete story arc in the span of a single <strong>one-shot</strong> session, but this usually requires special arrangements to expedite things and special expertise on the part of the World to move things along faster than usual. This kind of play is meant more as a way to <strong>demo</strong> and <strong>showcase</strong> the game than to actually enjoy all it has to offer, as many features can only emerge over a longer time span.</p><hr /><h2><strong>1.2 - Knowing the Rules</strong></h2><p><em><strong>Fantasy World</strong></em> is not a <em>pick-up</em> or a <em>play-as-you-read</em> kind of game. Before play can happen the World needs to carefully read the <strong>whole book</strong>.</p><p>If they are willing to do some extra work, they can let the Players start with little or no knowledge of the game, and then explain only what is needed, when it is needed. However, the game runs at its best <strong>when everyone knows the rules</strong>.</p><p>Players are encouraged to read this book and/or to learn its procedures through active play, and then to use such knowledge to <strong>help the World</strong> do their job. When someone (even the World) forgets or misunderstands some part of the rules it is everyone’s <strong>duty</strong> to point that out and correct them.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The One Golden Rule</strong></h3><p>The <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> is all about <strong>personal taste </strong>and<strong> mutual respect</strong>. The rule is active at all times throughout the whole game and it simply states that <strong>everyone</strong> at the table must <strong>like</strong> what everyone else says. What does this mean in practical terms?</p><p>The <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> is about <strong>how</strong> things are described, <strong>how</strong> each participant tells in their own words what they imagine is happening.</p><p>If <strong>anyone</strong> at the table thinks “<em>this looks wrong, it feels out of place, I don’t like it</em>” they <strong>can and should</strong> say so. <strong>Just one</strong> unhappy voice is all it takes to veto that specific description, with <strong>no vote </strong>or<strong> negotiation</strong>. Just ask the minimum amount of questions to understand what’s wrong and how best to change it.</p><blockquote><p>World - The town herbalist introduces himself as Dildo Fukkins and...</p><p>Player - Err... seriously? Come on! It's funny, but please come up with a more serious name.</p><p>World - You finally reach the outskirts of the forest, with its tall palm trees and...</p><p>Player - Wait, weren't we on a snowy mountain? It feels weird to have palm trees in such an environment. Are you sure they are specifically palm trees? Couldn't they just be pines? Or something?</p><p>World - ...and then it rends the flesh from the creature's neck. You hear a ripping wet sound...</p><p>Player - Hmm, it's all cool but... could you please tone down the gore?</p><p>Player - Enraged, I punch the stone wall, smashing it to bits!</p><p>World - Mmm, that's a bit too action-movie-y for me. Could you make it less over the top?</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What it is NOT for</strong></h3><p>Sometimes <strong>rules</strong> make things happen: this is indisputable.<br />If a dice roll causes your PC to take damage, and you don't like that, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> can't make you change the events to undo the damage. At most it allows you to request that the event be described differently: in a less graphic way or in a less humiliating/ridiculous way or perhaps in a more dramatic way or including/excluding some detail that is important to you. But the event takes place as established by the rules.</p><p>Sometimes <strong>choices</strong> make something happen: this too is indisputable.<br />If the World decides to perform one Reaction instead of another and consequently describes the environment and NPCs in a certain way, and you don't like that, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> can't make you change events to undo the effect of the Reaction.<br />If a Player makes a choice and describes his PC acting accordingly, and you don't like that, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> can't make you change events to force the Player into a different choice. As before, in either case, you can request a change in the <strong>description of how</strong> these events happen.</p><h3><strong>Explicit Trust</strong></h3><p>Sometimes there could be a good in-fiction reason to offer a seemingly jarring and out-of-place description. When this reason is clear to one participant (usually the World) but obscure to the others (usually the Players) it’s ok to <strong>ask</strong> for a bit of leeway “<em><strong>Trust me on this, they really are palm trees!</strong></em>”</p><p>This is an important difference from most other games, as Fantasy World encourages Players and World to <strong>not</strong> trust each other <strong>implicitly</strong>, but rather explicitly. It encourages everyone to <strong>always</strong> express doubts and problems and weird sensations so that others can acknowledge them and either <strong>openly ask</strong> for some extra trust or <strong>accept the critique</strong> and somehow address the issue.</p><p>Used sensibly, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> helps people <strong>listen to each other</strong> and have a more <strong>civil and friendly</strong> game conversation, helping everyone to voice, solve, and often prevent a whole category of very common RPG problems.</p><h3><strong>Safe Play</strong></h3><p>The <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> is not, strictly speaking, meant as a tool to make the game “safer” but rather as a practice to make the game “better” by facilitating communication among the people at the table. That said, it <strong>can</strong> also be used as a safety instrument.</p><p>First, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> works as a problem-detector.<br />Ignoring or abusing this rule highlights who is <strong>behaving badly</strong>, disrespectfully, or disruptively. In such cases, <strong>the game has to stop</strong>. No game can fix social problems for you, so <strong>stop the game</strong>, talk it out as human beings, possibly as friends, and try to <strong>understand each other</strong>. Sometimes the problematic behavior will turn out to have been just an unintentional mistake or some sort of miscommunication. Other times, deeper issues might emerge. Play should resume only if possible and desired. There is no shame in admitting that a specific combination of people are, for whatever reason, not able to play a certain game together. Acknowledge it, set the dice aside, and do something else that you all can enjoy together.</p><p>Second, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> can be leveraged in a protective way.<br />Remember when we said that this rule can’t be used to change the <strong>choices made by people at the table</strong>? This still stands, but it also highlights how an argument such as “<em>it’s not me, this is what the character would do</em>” has zero legs in Fantasy World. You, the person sitting beside me, are choosing to behave in a certain way. So while the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> doesn’t grant the power to instantly veto your choice without appeal, it nonetheless clarifies how everything happening at the table is because of <strong>deliberate Player and World choices</strong>. No childish in-fiction alibis are allowed.<br />This, on top of training participants to give voice to their game-related needs and issues, and by providing a formal/mechanical tool to do it, facilitates the conveyance of any sort of request. So while there are no direct tools to say “<em>Nope, cancel this whole thing</em>”, it is perfectly natural to express something like, “<em>I find the thing you are choosing to do problematic, could you please not do it?</em>”</p><hr /><h2><strong>1.3 - The Point of this Game</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Most other games require someone like the World to plan a story ahead of time. Or to guide Players through one of many possible pre-determined story branches.</p><p>Not in Fantasy World.</p><p>It is not needed, and actually detrimental to the good outcome of the play experience. The World is not a storyteller. They are just a Player with different tasks.</p></blockquote><p>In <em>Fantasy World</em> both the World and the Players share a single true objective, one core reason to sit down and play: <strong>to find out</strong>.</p><p>Find out things about the <strong>characters</strong>. What kind of person is my PC? What do they love and hate? What do they desire and fear? What are they willing to do about that? What will the sad farmer NPC do when confronted with this choice?</p><p>Find out things about the <strong>setting</strong>. What lies hidden in the forest? What marvels and terrors await beyond the next hill? How are the inhabitants of this land like me? How are they different? What would they consider art? Are the stories about the legendary treasure true?</p><p>Find out things about the ongoing <strong>story</strong>. Will the ork warlord conquer the salt plains? Will the spider queen poison the eternal fountain? Will the Fellowship save the dragon from the evil princess? Will our Priest preserve their faith?</p><p>You play because <strong>you don’t know</strong>. The answers could be <strong>anything</strong>. Possibly something <strong>you never would have expected</strong>. Of course, you have a hand in how things play out, but you will also need to be open to foreign ideas, be willing to be surprised, partly let go of what you hoped for, and embrace what others put on your plate. If you are determined to have things go your own way no matter what, then there are going to be problems when both the rules and the other participants eventually push back. Don’t be that person!</p><h3><strong>Core Elements</strong></h3><p>The tone and details of your campaign will depend on the moment-by-moment choices of all participants: some will go for a bleak and gritty outlook, others will bask in the light of epic high fantasy, and others will try for comedy and hijinks, etc. That said, a few elements will always be present in any iteration of <em>Fantasy World</em>.</p><h4><strong>Dramatic Fantasy</strong></h4><p>This kind of fantasy puts emphasis on <strong>social ties</strong>. Protagonists don’t exist in a relational vacuum: they come from somewhere, they care for something, and in general, they are tied to a network of people who have names and faces and meaning within the Protagonists’ lives. This is then mirrored in every other character in the narrative, be they secondary characters, random people, even animals and monsters... and the “villains” of the story.</p><p>Another staple of this genre is personal <strong>accountability</strong> for one’s own choices and actions. Whatever you do, or don’t do, has an impact on other people’s lives, the consequences of which will be shown by the narrative.</p><p>In dramatic fantasy, the <strong>morality</strong> of actions is never inherently and obviously good or evil. This does not mean that good and evil do not exist, or that everything is relative and thus nothing matters. No. Instead, these stories engage the Protagonists in an open and critical discovery of what good and evil mean for them, personally. The <strong>gods are silent</strong> game truth has a lot to do with this element.</p><h4><strong>Fellowship</strong></h4><p>The game follows the story of a Fellowship of adventurous Protagonists. The scene-by-scene action can often see each PC doing their own thing individually, but overall the Fellowship is <strong>always united</strong> and working towards a common goal.</p><p>The emergent story might go in a direction where PCs will want (or have) to leave the Fellowship. This is possible and interesting, but in so doing the parting PCs will also <strong>leave active play</strong>, turning into NPCs. Their Players will continue to play by creating new PCs that fit the Fellowship and its goals. Theoretically, if it made sense in a hypothetical future, Players could have these ex-PGs \"come back\" and regain their direct control.</p><h4><strong>Violence</strong></h4><p><strong>Violence</strong> has swift, brutal, and messy consequences. Stepping into a fight is no laughing matter, and even in victory the wounds suffered will have a meaningful impact as <strong>there is no way to instantaneously heal</strong> them. Getting hurt is easy. Being healed is hard. This is intentional.</p><p><em>Fantasy World</em> is often <strong>much less violent</strong> than other adventure games because of its serious approach to the topic. Taken lightly, violence is meaningless and most games present it as an effective tool to solve any problem. Taken seriously, it puts Players in front of difficult and interesting choices both on the tactical and the emotional level.</p><h4><strong>Protagonism</strong></h4><p>Although the World is a very important participant, as they literally run the world, the <strong>Players are the true engine</strong> of any story. Right from the start their Protagonists can <strong>make a difference</strong>, push things around, and change society. But they will also face risks, be held accountable for the consequences of their actions, and might also <strong>fail</strong> in their endeavors.</p><p>To succeed in anything they have to act smartly and proactively. <strong>They are offered opportunities</strong>, but it is up to them to realise or squander them.</p><h4><strong>Fantasy Genres</strong></h4><p>Whether you play by referencing an outside source (a novel? a comic book? a movie? a video game?) or an original creation to which all participants have contributed, the important thing is to make sure you have \"adapted\" it to the <strong>core elements</strong> just described. The rest is secondary and can be rendered as you see fit. The tone of the story can be light and hopeful, or grim and cynical. It can feature high bombastic wizardry or low subtle magic. You can easily steal the trappings of other fantasy genres to tell a Fantasy World version of those stories. All of this is made easy by the game mechanics and doesn’t require much effort or awareness.</p><p>A Fantasy World version of <em><strong>Lord of the Rings</strong></em> would still be a wondrous and epic journey, but without the binary morality. <em>Fantasy World</em> frames <strong>everything</strong>, even animals, objects, and places, as \"people\" (I'll explain this well later) and so Sauron, as powerful and alien an entity as he may be, would still be presented and handled as \"a person\": driven by motivations, hopes, fears, meaningful relationships, past experiences, etc. Could one bargain with Sauron? Could he be blackmailed? Or deceived? Could he be redeemed? Could he be understood? Could one be \"corrupted\" by his logic and worldview? What about his followers? Are they all incapable of change?<br />In Tolkien's text, the answer to all of these questions is simply \"no.\" Evil is evil, good is good. In <em>Fantasy World</em>, however, these are open-ended issues where the very act of asking the question and pondering the answer constitutes the beating heart of the game experience. It's a matter of \"<em>the journey matters more than the destination.</em>\"</p><p>Most of the <em><strong>Cosmere</strong></em> stories written by Brandon Sanderson would fit right in, as they really are a varied patchwork of very different narrative genres tied together by them happening in the same setting and sporting the same “hard” magic system: the <em><strong>Mistborn</strong></em> book series blends elements of caper story, coming of age story, war story, detective story, and more into one sprawling saga, made unique by its peculiar metal-inspired magic. And while in Sanderson’s universe “gods” can meddle quite a bit in their world’s affairs, they are also “just people”: very powerful magical entities, but in no way omnipotent, omniscient and infallible and, as such, the Protagonists’ choices remain open to critique and their own sole responsibility. The <em>Fantasy World</em> version of these stories would simply lean a bit harder on this distinction, at least as far as the Protagonists are concerned.</p><p><em><strong>Harry Potter</strong></em>-like sagas work very well within the boundaries of Fantasy World, and the same goes for stories like the ones portrayed in the <em><strong>Dresden Files</strong></em> and <em><strong>Rivers of London</strong></em> series. Only, with a focus on the ensemble of Protagonists making up a Fellowship rather than on the individual “chosen one”. Similarly, narratives like the ones from <em><strong>The Witcher</strong></em> or <em><strong>Game of Thrones</strong></em> can easily be played with Fantasy World if one zooms in on the events surrounding a single Fellowship rather than spreading out to follow multiple separate storylines.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Fluid Play &amp; Breaks</strong></h3><p>Playing this game is <strong>not</strong> a performance.</p><p>The show must <strong>not</strong> go on at all costs.</p><p>Winging it when rules are not clear does <strong>not</strong> usually lead to satisfying results.</p><p>In <em>Fantasy World</em> the best way to achieve immersion, engagement, and fluidity of play is to <strong>take a short break</strong> whenever needed. <em>Fantasy World</em> asks the participants to be creative and spontaneous, to improvise ideas, dialogues, descriptions, and important choices. The rules make such activities as easy as possible, but play will still require energy, especially from the World. <strong>Calling for a short break</strong> every once in a while during a session will help everyone to stay fresh, make better choices, and enjoy the game more. <strong>Take breaks</strong> even in the midst of fast and furious fictional action! <strong>At the table</strong> there is no need to rush: think things through, ask for suggestions and help, or just take a breather.</p><p>With just a bit of practice, the rules in this book will become familiar and easy to use, but it's still quite natural to sometimes forget a detail or to have conflicting opinions on what a rule says. <strong>Don’t argue</strong>! Instead, <strong>take a short break</strong> to check what’s in the book. A few minutes invested in page-flipping during an early session will help everyone learn the rules properly and promote <strong>faster and more fluid</strong> play in future ones.</p><p>When the text fails to clarify how to use a rule, then it is recommended to <strong>defer the decision to the majority</strong> of the table. Again, <strong>don’t argue</strong>! Just lay down the options, vote, and move on. If the vote is inconclusive, then the World breaks the tie. A lengthier discussion about how to interpret the offending rule in future sessions can and should happen <strong>after the session ends</strong> and possibly sometime <strong>before the next</strong> play meeting. This gives everyone time to reflect on how things went, how they would like them to go in the future, ask online for help and clarifications, etc.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Things to always do</strong></h3><p>While playing there are a few things that any participant can do which will improve the game for everyone:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask questions</strong> like crazy. Be curious about each other’s characters and the world around them.</li><li><strong>Make maps</strong> like crazy. And sketches, diagrams, and any kind of ephemera that seems interesting.</li><li>Seriously... <strong>ask questions</strong>! The World should ask all kinds of <strong>internal</strong> questions to the PCs (how do you feel about X, what do you want from Y, are you being sincere with Z, etc,), while Players should ask questions about anything, especially when they feel <strong>stuck or lost</strong> and don't have a clear idea of how to pursue the Protagonists' goals. The answers will often give hints about possible next steps, pushing the game forward.</li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Timeline of Play</strong></h3><p>After you have finished reading the entire rulebook, these will be the steps for preparing and conducting the game:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Game Prep</strong><br />Decide who will play the role of World and who the Players will be. It is necessary for each Player to have a copy of the <strong>Class Playbook</strong> they choose to play. It is helpful for everyone to have a copy of the <strong>Common Moves Sheet</strong>. The World must have a copy of the <strong>World Sheet</strong>, the <strong>Agent Map</strong> and the <strong>Agents Sheet</strong> available. Having blank sheets of paper on which to take notes will probably be helpful to everyone. Gather your dice, pencils and erasers, some drinks and snacks, and you're good to go!</p></li><li><p><strong>First Session</strong><br />The World leads all Players through the <em>First Session</em> procedures, explaining fundamental rules, helping out with the creation of each PC, their Fellowship, and a few basic details of the game setting. These activities are already <strong>active play</strong> as everyone is already imagining and describing stuff, planting the seeds of future stories and getting to know the Protagonists and the world around them, <strong>discovering</strong> the places where their lives are unstable, tenuous, and unpredictable. This directly feeds the World in the creation of lively and engaging locations, characters, and other game elements (all called Agents).</p></li><li><p><strong>Subsequent Sessions</strong><br />The World builds and <strong>escalates</strong> on what happened during the previous session, pushing the situation, following the logic of the Agents to its conclusion, acting and reacting to the Players’ choices and actions.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":375000,"name":"Essential Mechanics","type":"text","_id":"bOBBcPlGKll45WZB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>2.1 - Moves in Play</h2><p>Moves are small bits of rules that activate when a specific fiction happens. Some moves are common and always available to every Protagonist. Some moves are unique to a specific Class. All moves are always structured to have two parts: a <strong>fictional trigger</strong> and some sort of <strong>effect</strong>.</p><p>Moves work in a straightforward way: when a Protagonist is described (usually while doing something) in a way that <strong>looks like</strong> what is written in the trigger of a move, then the stuff written in the effect happens.</p><blockquote><p>Example move #01</p><p>When you talk to a stranger about the ways and traditions of your people...</p><p>... they will listen captivated and (they choose one):</p><p>Express contempt, and remember how you look.</p><p>Express interest, and offer something in kind.</p><p>Express awe, and remember who you are.</p></blockquote><p>Performing a move is not an entirely free choice. <strong>If you do it, you do it.</strong> There is no way to describe something that looks like a move trigger without also causing the associated move effect. By the same token, it is not possible to obtain the effect of a move without first describing something that looks like that move’s trigger. <strong>To do it, you have to do it.</strong></p><p>But the game is not out to get you.</p><p>Once a Player realises that their description would trigger an undesired move, they can retract the description and <strong>describe something different</strong> in its place. Feel free to ask the other participants for ideas, inspiration, and suggestions.</p><blockquote><p>Player - I say something to the innkeeper so that he unmistakably remembers me, like my move says.</p><p>World - Err, sure... what do you say?</p><p>Player - I don't know. Something. I have the move, can't it just work?</p><p>Word - No can do. Unless you describe something about your traditions and ways, it's not the move.</p></blockquote><p>There are many kinds of moves: some require a dice roll, some require additional descriptions, some have a cost, some offer multiple choices, some have immediate effects, some have effects that can happen at a later time, etc.</p><p>But more or less all follow the basic principle that <strong>when you describe A, then B happens</strong>.</p><p><strong>Only the Players use moves</strong>. The World uses something different, designed to help them react to the Players’ questions and actions in interesting ways. For this reason, they are called Reactions and are explained in a separate section of this book.</p><p>In the following section, I’ll showcase a few common problems and mistakes that happen when using moves, and how to best solve them. This is a useful read for both World and Players.</p><blockquote><p>If you do it, you do it</p><p>Player - I tell the innkeeper that where I come from we offer free wine to the guests.</p><p>World - This triggers the Example move #01... so... as he listens to you, an expression of disgust twists his face. \"Cheap ass!\" he mumbles under his breath while walking away.</p><p>[Moreover, the World takes note that the innkeeper will remember the PC's face]</p><p>Player - Wait, I just wanted to state a fun fact. I don't want to activate the move!</p><p>World - No can do. If you tell him about your traditions, it is the move. Do you want to change what your PC says and does?</p></blockquote><h3>Calling moves</h3><p><strong>It is every participant’s job</strong> to keep an eye on the fiction to see if it triggers any moves. When someone thinks they have seen a move triggered, they can and should <strong>call it out</strong>.</p><p>A common error is to “call” moves <strong>before</strong> a description is offered. Usually, this happens when the World feels like there should be a dice roll, so they ignore the rules and say something like “<em>Wayfarer, roll on Daring!</em>” or maybe “<em>Scoundrel, roll to Take a Risk!</em>”. This is outright <strong>wrong</strong>.</p><p>The World <strong>can never</strong> say something like “<em>Wayfarer, roll on Daring!</em>” as <strong>there is no such thing</strong> in <em>Fantasy World</em>; either you roll because a move is triggered, or you don’t roll at all.</p><p>The World <strong>can never</strong> say something like “<em>Scoundrel, roll to Take a Risk!</em>” as the World has no authority to decide such a thing on their own; either a description triggers a move, or there is no move.</p><p>The correct way to call a move, by the World or by another Player, is to <strong>ask</strong>...</p><blockquote><p>World - Occultist, wait, are you attempting a Sway?</p><p>World - Veteran, this sounds difficult, is it a Take a Risk?</p><p>World - Knight, are you using your Authority?</p></blockquote><p>If looking at the move trigger and at the described fiction everyone quickly agrees that yes, right, obviously this is that move, <strong>then it is</strong>. Otherwise, it is not.</p><p>Only in case of widespread doubt or disagreement the <strong>World is the final arbiter</strong>, keeping in mind that it is good and healthy to review this quick judgment and look deeper into the rules after the session ends.</p><p>This helps Players to be more involved in the game even when their PC is not in the spotlight, and to more quickly learn and become aware of the rules being used. It also makes it easier for the World to correctly follow the other procedures of this game.</p><blockquote><p>Player_1 - I tell the innkeeper that where I come from we offer free wine to the guests.</p><p>World - He says \"Feh!\" and kind of ignores you...</p><p>Player_2 - Wait, this looks like the Example move #01, doesn't it?</p><p>World - Oh, right! Let me rewind. As he listens to you an expression of disgust twists his face. \"Cheap ass!\" he mumbles under his breath while walking away.</p><p>[Moreover, the World takes note that the innkeeper will remember the PC's face]</p></blockquote><h3>Undescribed moves</h3><p>A common problem arises when a Player <strong>states</strong> that their character makes a move, or only expresses a move-like <strong>intent</strong>, without actually describing their character’s actions in the fiction.</p><p>The point of this is <strong>not</strong> to force complex descriptions or thespian performances out of the Player, but rather to clarify <strong>what</strong> is happening in the fiction and (more or less) <strong>how</strong> it is happening. Such details aren't just decorative or aesthetic but are very important for the <strong>game mechanics</strong> as they inform what will happen next.</p><p>Depending on how an attack is described, the <em><strong>Brawl</strong></em> move will cause different kinds of damage, achieve different tactical goals, maybe require a different set-up move before the <em><strong>Brawl</strong></em> itself can happen, etc.</p><p>Depending on what the PC does to <em><strong>Look Around,</strong></em> the World will offer visual information, auditive details, olfactory notes, describe what was hidden behind a curtain... or not, if the action as described does not justify the disclosure of such info.</p><p>Describing how a PC tries to trick another character tells the target’s owner how to react; maybe it is the perfect thing to say and no move is triggered, the trick just works; maybe it is a stretch and the character doubts the PC, leading to one move or another; maybe it is totally unbelievable or nonsensical, so then the PC’s owner should be informed of that, allowing them to reformulate, or even invoke the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> if needed.</p><blockquote><p>Player - I do Brawl on the ork.</p><p>Player - I Look Around in this room.</p><p>Player - I try to trick that guy.</p><p>In each of these cases, the World's answer should invariably be...</p><p>World - Cool, describe how you do that.</p></blockquote><h3>Unintentional moves</h3><p>Another problem is when a Player has their PC take actions that count as moves but <strong>doesn’t realise it</strong>, or <strong>doesn’t intend it</strong> to be a move.</p><blockquote><p>Player - I casually shove the guard out of my way.</p><p>World - Cool, that looks like a Threaten move to me, yes?</p><p>Player - Wait, what?</p><p>World - The guard is blocking the door and won't budge willingly; if you are serious about shoving the guard around then you are using physical force to have him do what you want. A textbook Threaten move.</p><p>Player - Oh! No, I'm not serious, I'm just brushing him aside. It might be rude but I'm not really threatening anyone, that's not my intention anyway.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Intentions are irrelevant</strong>. If a PC does something that <strong>looks</strong> like a move trigger, then <strong>it is</strong> that move. As previously explained, instead of punishing Players for unintentional mistakes, the rules allow for a quick and painless re-do. An acceptable answer might thus be:</p><blockquote><p>Player - Oh! No, if he's really blocking the door, whatever, I'll go away and look for another way in.</p><p>Another example...</p><p>Occultist - I want this nobleman to help our mission, but I don't want to force his hand. I'll just make pleasant and idle conversation with him talking about the weather, the guilds, the latest fashion... and some questions about his daughter, like, \"has she found a fiancee yet?\"</p><p>World - Well, it looks like a Sway to me, don't you agree? You're pressuring him.</p><p>Occultist - What? How?</p><p>World - Your PC knows that his daughter has been kidnapped by unknown bandits and that he is skittish about it. By asking for help and then mentioning her, he takes it as a veiled threat. Looks like a Sway to me.</p><p>Occultist - No no no, I didn't mean to! I'm just curious about his daughter; can't I talk in a way that makes it clear I'm not blackmailing him? Maybe I'll ask how the search is going and then offer my help?</p><p>World - Ok. Then when you offer help he basically jumps on you \"Yes oh mighty wizard, help me save my daughter! Bring her back alive and I'll support your mission any way I can!\"</p></blockquote><h3>Ambiguous moves</h3><p>At times the same description could reasonably look like the trigger for different moves. The rule here is that <strong>a more specific move trumps a more generic one</strong>. In this regard <em><strong>Take a Risk</strong></em> could very well be the most generic move in the whole game; use it <strong>only</strong> if no other move fits the fiction as described.</p><blockquote><p>Player - I casually shove the guard out of my way.</p><p>World - Cool, that looks like a Threaten move to me, yes?</p><p>Player - Wait, the guard is dangerous, can't I Take a Risk?</p><p>World - You are facing danger, true, but you are doing so by using immediate physical force to get someone to do something for you. It's the very definition of the Threaten move, so it takes precedence.</p></blockquote><p>Other times peculiar circumstances might muck up things. The solution is to <strong>look closer at the fiction</strong>, considering the specific circumstances and the details that appear to be relevant. The presence of descriptive Tags (chapter 2 section 2) attached to creatures, items, locations, or the situation itself can be of further help. And of course, everyone should <strong>ask questions</strong> to clarify what is going on, and how, and why. Maybe the Player’s intention could be better served by a different clearer description, than by sticking to the current unclear one.</p><blockquote><p>Veteran - I draw my sword and swing it at the dragon. It's Brawl, right?</p><p>World - Actually no. The dragon has scales like sheets of metal one centimeter thick and is as big as a three-story building. It's obvious that your sword attacks will connect with its paws and flanks to no meaningful effect; the action you described has no chance of inflicting any harm, so it can't trigger the Brawl move. Do you still want to charge head-on?</p></blockquote><hr /><h2>2.2 - Fictional Gaming</h2><h3>Fictional Positioning</h3><p>What a character is allowed to do depends on what each Player and the World agree makes sense. Can the character walk? Can they run? Can they swim? Can they fly? Can they wield an axe? Can they summon ghosts? It’s not about testing their abilities. It’s about defining what Players are allowed to describe moment by moment.</p><p>At times this agreement is obvious and implicit: <em>of course Zusanna can walk!</em></p><p>At times this agreement needs to be spelled out and explained: <em>why not? It makes sense for Zusanna to walk!</em></p><p>At times this agreement is conflictual and in need of resolution: <em>can Zusanna walk? Let's discuss!</em></p><p>In any case, the agreement can depend on a thousand little details that make more or less sense to each Player. The sum of these elements is called <strong>Fictional Positioning</strong>: the position, the circumstances, of a certain thing within the fiction we all describe to one another.</p><p>In most cases, you won’t need to worry about it. Everything will appear obvious and evident as you play. In some cases, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> is the most useful tool to solve doubts and conflicts. And in general, having a clear idea about who has the <strong>authority</strong> to describe a certain portion of the game narrative is always helpful; this rulebook tries to be as clear as possible about this whenever possible.</p><h3>Fictional Tags</h3><p>A fictional Tag is nothing more than a specific narrative detail that the game highlights. The Tag makes Players and World take notice of such detail, which in turn makes it more present and relevant in active play. Some game mechanics, like Advantage and Disadvantage (chapter 2 section 3), leverage the presence of Tags and the way in which characters interact with them. By convention, a Tag is always written in short bold and italics text in square brackets: <em><strong>[this is a Tag]</strong></em>. There is no exhaustive list of official Tags, but these rules will offer a few examples of common Tags whenever relevant.</p><p>A Tag could relate to an item (a <em><strong>[heavy]</strong></em> dress), a location (an <em><strong>[eerie]</strong></em> house), a character (an <em><strong>[honest]</strong></em> innkeeper), or anything that has a quality that needs to be highlighted. The Tag can even be the thing in itself, to communicate how the sum of its characteristics (whichever they might be) is noteworthy and game-relevant; for example: <em><strong>[The Sword of Omens]</strong></em> or maybe <em><strong>[Gian-Gengis, the new kid in town]</strong></em>.</p><p><strong>Anyone</strong> can establish a new Tag <strong>at any time</strong> if the table agrees. Just know that too many Tags only create confusion and dilute the effectiveness of this mechanic, so it’s important to only focus on defining Tags that communicate something <strong>important</strong> or <strong>exceptional</strong> or that the World and Players find <strong>particularly interesting</strong>. It’s a reminder for the table that a certain thing should be in everyone’s mind, actively touched on by the story.</p><p>For the same reason, anyone can <strong>ask</strong> that a certain Tag be <strong>removed</strong>: maybe circumstances changed and the Tag doesn’t represent the fiction anymore, or maybe Player interests changed and the Tag is not worth keeping around anymore. Think of this as decluttering, as reorganising and updating the shared notes on what people at the table should keep in their minds.</p><blockquote><p>Any blade is somewhat sharp and able to cut things, thus there is no need to use the [sharp] Tag. The blade is a blade and gives you the fictional positioning necessary to do all the things that a person can expect to do with a blade. So if a blade is [sharp] it means it is extraordinarily so, enough to set it apart from other blades. By the same token, blades don't usually emanate magical light and if your blade does so it makes sense to Tag it as [radiant] or something similar.</p></blockquote><h3>Moves &amp; Positioning</h3><p>Moves <strong>suggest</strong> fictional positioning, but they do not grant nor enforce it. That power lies with the agreement of the table, as regulated by the general rules of the game. Here are some specific cases for which this is relevant:</p><ul><li>A move does a thing.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I don’t have that move.<br />Can I do the thing?<br /><strong>Probably. It depends!</strong></p></blockquote><p>A move that triggers “<strong>when you run</strong>” suggests that a PC is generally capable of running. And when they do, special effects will occur. But it appears obvious, probably by unspoken agreement, that anyone else without that move is also capable of running, even though no special effect will occur. It also appears obvious that when a PC is tied to a table they can not run, even though they have a move that triggers “<strong>when you run</strong>”. So a PC’s ability to run is less dependent on the absence or presence of a move, and much more influenced by things like their fictional circumstances, their Player’s clever ideas and descriptions, and game elements such as Blood, Kin, and Class.</p><p>Similarly, the very definition of \"running\" is open to the judgment of the table: is a Protagonist in a wheelchair who is frantically pushing to accelerate \"running\"? Probably, and so if they have the move, it will be triggered.</p><ul><li>A move does a SPECIAL thing.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I don’t have that move.<br />Can I do the thing?<br /><strong>Probably. It depends!</strong></p></blockquote><p>Is the Occultist the only character (PC or NPC) who can <strong>“work magic”</strong> in the entire world? Or can someone else do it even though they don’t have the Occultist’s moves? The answer is: <strong>it depends</strong> on the current fictional positioning of the character being considered at the moment. It depends on the agreements that the table silently shares and overtly discusses during active play.</p><ul><li>I can do a thing.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I have a move for when I do that thing in a certain way. Can I do that thing in a different way?<br /><strong>Probably. It depends!</strong></p></blockquote><p>The Wildcaller has moves that allow them to “<em><strong>call on the spirits</strong></em>” of nature to achieve a selection of specific feats. Can they also “<em>call on the spirits</em>” to do something else? To have a chat, or to receive guidance, or to ask for a favor? Probably. Being the Wildcaller and possessing moves that establish one’s ability to “<em>call on the spirits</em>” makes for a pretty clear fictional positioning in this regard.</p><p>Of course, general game rules still apply: if they describe something that triggers a move, it is the move, but if the description does not trigger a move, then the World describes what happens according to their own judgment.</p><ul><li>I can do a thing.</li></ul><blockquote><p>There are moves that add cool special effects when I do that thing. Can I get those effects even if I don’t have the appropriate moves?<br /><strong>In theory, yes. In practice, it’s unlikely. It depends!</strong></p></blockquote><p>As most move effects are mainly fictional, it is possible to arrange things in such a way as to have the right fictional positioning to achieve similar results without owning the proper move. It will probably require a lot of work, whose outcome depends on unreliable circumstances and is ultimately at the mercy of the World’s whim (not a move? the World decides!). But if everyone agrees that it makes sense, then it’s clever play that can happen and should even be rewarded.</p><p>That said, having the proper move makes everything easier, clearer, and more official. This grants the Player unparalleled control over what goes on in the game: if your description triggers a move, it’s the move.</p><hr /><h3>Difficulty</h3><p>There is no numerical concept of “difficulty” in this game. If a description triggers a move, it’s the move. No modifiers apply. The way to convey varying degrees of difficulty is instead to <strong>use the fiction to highlight</strong> costs, consequences, and obstacles. Look at how the following examples make life more or less difficult for the PCs.</p><p>First, let me present you with a basic situation:</p><blockquote><p>World - A city guard bars your way, wielding a sword. \"Stop!\" he yells.</p><p>Veteran - I rush towards the poor sod and chop him to small bits. I trigger the Brawl move, right?</p><p>World - Sounds about right.</p></blockquote><p>Then one possible, more difficult, alternative:</p><blockquote><p>World - A city guard bars your way, wielding a spear. \"Stop!\" he yells, bringing the pole arm between the two of you.</p><p>Veteran - I rush towards the poor sod and chop him to small bits. I trigger the Brawl move, right?</p><p>World - Nope, you have forgotten the spear! It's long and the guard is doing his best to keep you at bay. Unless you get past the spear's reach your sword simply won't connect. What do you do about it?</p><p>Veteran - I fight my way to him, parrying and deflecting away from his spear... then he will bleed!</p><p>World - Cool, looks like you can Take a Risk to close the distance. If you succeed then it will be a Brawl.</p></blockquote><p>In these examples, we see how, by simply <strong>highlighting important elements of the fiction</strong> (the spear is long) and by describing their obvious effect on the situation (the spear keeps you at a distance) the World creates real and meaningful obstacles, which in turn lead the Player to describe different things, which will then trigger different moves. This also puts the Protagonist in a position where they need to <strong>ponder solutions</strong> to problems, make <strong>hard choices</strong>, and perform <strong>set-up actions</strong> before they can do the thing they originally wanted to do.</p><p>This is the concrete effect of <strong>fictional positioning</strong>: when <strong>how</strong> you describe stuff, and <strong>what</strong> stuff you describe, is important and makes a difference.</p><p>Finally, another even more difficult example:</p><blockquote><p>World - A city guard bars your way, wielding a sword. \"Stop!\" he yells, his metal armor clinking with his every move.</p><p>Veteran - I rush towards the poor sod and chop him to small bits. I trigger the Brawl move, right?</p><p>World - Nope, you easily manage to hit him multiple times but every attack collides with his armor producing a shower of sparks and no visible damage. And it feels like he's weirdly rooted to the ground. This is not normal! What do you do?</p><p>Veteran - Damn. Is any part of his body exposed?</p><p>World - You easily spot a small section of the helmet that shows his eyes. Do you look closer? Do you want to know more?</p><p>Veteran - Nah, I have all the info I need. I keep the guard occupied with my right-hand swordplay while reaching for my hunting knife with my left hand, and then drive it deep into his eye-holes!</p><p>World - Cool, looks like a Brawl! But it's obvious by his movements that he is aware of this weak point and is fighting to defend it, plus it's a very small target that constantly moves ... a very difficult endeavor!</p><p>If you just randomly hack at his eyes you can only hope to inflict light cuts and scratches, nothing more than a Temp nuisance.</p><p>If you want to really drive the blade deep for a Serious or maybe Deadly hit, you'll have to expose yourself to Deadly danger.</p><p>Or you could come up with some better ideas. What do you do?</p><p>Do you want to know more?</p><p>This question is not being asked randomly. It's the trigger for the Look Around move. The World is signaling and facilitating it for the Player.</p><p>A Tough Choice</p><p>This is also not a chance dialogue. The World presented an obstacle and the Player chose to undertake a dangerous and difficult path. This offers the opportunity for a World Reaction. In this case, it is to show an opportunity.</p></blockquote><h4>Impossible Obstacles</h4><p>Describing something as “<strong>too much</strong>” is another way to crank the difficulty up while also promoting <strong>creative play.</strong> Presenting something as too distant, too big, too fast, too protected, etc. forces the Players to devise alternative solutions: a common broadsword can barely scratch the tank-like scales of a dragon, or the wall-like body of a stone golem, or an a-hole guard clad in magical armor... but are there any weak spots? Are there alternative solutions? Are there possibilities other than direct combat?</p><p>This technique is effective, but the World should <strong>not abuse it</strong>. Obstacles, especially \"impossible\" ones, should always be presented as <strong>practical</strong> and somehow <strong>understandable</strong>. To this end, be sure to always <strong>show</strong> signs of what's going on (<em>the sparks</em>) and to even explain them in plain terms (<em>this is not normal!</em>) if any doubt arises.</p><h4>Costly Choices</h4><p>Yet another way to communicate difficulty is to toy around with the <strong>cost</strong> of things. Simply striking a target wherever costs you nothing, just make the move. But striking a target in a difficult spot or in a difficult way? It might cost <strong>time</strong>, a thing that the World will make important and interesting. It might cost <strong>danger</strong>, exposing a character to harm or undesired consequences. It might cost <strong>effort</strong>, to find other solutions, to describe things in a different way, to perform necessary set-up actions.</p><h4>Just State the Obvious</h4><p>At times the World might have a feeling that a situation should be more difficult, but not exactly know why. Then they look at this chapter and believe that to apply these techniques, they need to come up with something new, something extra to add to the situation to make it difficult.<br />This is <strong>false</strong>.<br />The World simply needs to describe what is already on their mind, to calmly go over what was already narrated but this time stopping to highlight the elements that they deem could ramp up the difficulty. The example of the guard with a sword/spear is emblematic of this technique. More clarity in a difficult situation is always valuable for the Players, but it also helps the World to better understand what in their mind makes them <strong>feel</strong> that the situation is difficult, which in turn helps them <strong>express</strong> the appropriate fictional positioning and <em>World Reactions</em> (usually <strong>Open</strong> ones, to set Players up for subsequent danger and consequences).</p><hr /><h3>Spotlight Management</h3><p><strong>This game is a conversation</strong> between the Players and the World, a back and forth of actions, Reactions, questions, answers, moves, consequences. It is the World’s job to <strong>manage the flow</strong> of this within a scene, giving a fair share of the <strong>spotlight</strong> to each Player, ensuring that they all have equal opportunities to talk, participate, and shine. This means four things:</p><ul><li>Hold back the most exuberant Players, just a tiny bit.</li><li>Provide space and encouragement for the less confident Players, without pushing them.</li><li>Give due attention to important NPCs, so they don’t disappear into the background.</li><li>Break the chain of snowballing moves.</li></ul><h4>Static Spotlight</h4><p>When the situation is not particularly hectic, you can simply have a leisurely conversation. Every Player describes the actions and thoughts of their PC, the World describes what the NPCs say and do and how the environment looks and feels and behaves. Everyone keeps an eye out for moves, and play flows on from there.</p><h4>Dynamic Spotlight</h4><p>Often the PCs will <strong>split</strong>, going to different locations to do different things on their own. In this case, everything works the same, but looking for moves becomes extra important. As a rule of thumb, triggering a move becomes the <strong>climax of the scene</strong>. Play it out, <strong>resolve the move,</strong> and then cut. This way the scene is functionally <strong>complete</strong>, as it produced a meaningful outcome. When later the spotlight comes back to this Protagonist, both World and Player will be free to either move the story forward with a new location/situation or to continue doing stuff in the same location, although the situation will be different because of the move results.</p><blockquote><p>Split Spotlight</p><p>Triggering a move becomes the climax of the scene.</p></blockquote><p>When the PCs are split, the World should avoid cutting a scene short before a move is resolved, unless the spotlight Players are rambling on and <strong>not getting to the point</strong>. Aka, not getting to a move. If the PCs are all together, this would be relaxed play but, since some Players are just watching and waiting, the World should push a little bit, gently directing the conversation towards a move, or cutting it short to be resumed later, when the spotlight returns.</p><h4>Hectic &amp; Tense Spotlight</h4><p>The best way to handle the spotlight in a hectic situation (especially in the heat of combat) is to go around the table asking for everybody’s <strong>intentions</strong>, but <strong>don’t roll dice yet</strong>! Give everybody a turn to say what they’re doing, and let them change their mind if they need to; nothing happens until everyone’s had their say. Be sure to <strong>include your NPCs</strong> in the process. Paint a clear picture of what is happening.</p><p>To <strong>increase the pressure</strong> the World can declare their NPCs’ actions first. This provides the Players with useful information but also forces them into a reactive stance, which is often dangerous and challenging.</p><p>Conversely, to <strong>reduce the pressure</strong> a little, the World can ask the Players “<em>what do you do?</em>” first and only then describe how the NPCs react.</p><p>NPCs first = more pressure</p><p>PCs first = less pressure</p><p>Either way, this is how the World <strong>sets things up</strong>. Not by sucker-punching the Players with hidden prep work, but by offering full disclosure information about what happens around the PCs. This is important for many <em>World Reactions</em>, as explained in a later chapter. This approach also produces more dynamic scenes, where things happen moment by moment, the situation is bustling with activity, and the PCs face meaningful choices simply because they won’t be able to do everything at once.</p><p>Sucker-punching = bad</p><p>Making them choose = good</p><p>Once it is clear what everyone’s going to do, the participants <strong>evaluate the fiction to see which moves apply</strong> (if any) and then resolve them in the order that makes the most sense according to each move’s internal logic. Anyone can and should help with this, but it is specifically the World’s job to decide the resolution <strong>timing</strong>.</p><p>Sometimes a Protagonist’s action <strong>won’t count as a move</strong>. That’s okay. The World simply acknowledges what was described, considers how it fits with everyone else’s actions, and tells them what happens. That’s right: if a PC’s action doesn’t trigger a move, <strong>the World freely decides</strong> which effects and consequences it yields.</p><p>Sometimes a Protagonist’s action <strong>will count as more than one move</strong>. That’s okay. Have the Protagonist resolve them all, one at a time, in the order that makes more sense, and see what happens as a consequence of each. At times a move in the chain will change the situation so that the subsequent moves won’t be triggered anymore; so be it, they don’t happen and the conversation resumes.</p><p>Sometimes resolving actions and moves will <strong>change the situation</strong> enough that a character (either PC and NPC) will want to rethink their yet-unresolved declared action. That’s ok. If it makes sense in the fiction, let them <strong>revisit their intention</strong> and describe the new action.</p><p>After all, actions have been resolved the World could offer a brief recap of how the situation has changed. <strong>This might often be unnecessary</strong>, but for some groups it’s a good way to keep everyone on the same page. If the situation has been settled, move on with the game. Otherwise, a new round of action declarations will begin.</p><p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em></p><ol><li>Declare PC/NPC intentions.</li><li>Resolve moves.</li><li>Assess the new situation.</li><li>Repeat from 1. or move on with free narration.</li></ol><hr /><h2>2.3 - Rolling Dice</h2><p>Some moves have a straightforward effect. You do one thing, thus another thing happens. Other moves instead call for a dice roll, and that’s the <strong>only</strong> time Players ever roll dice. You always roll two six-sided dice (<strong>2d6</strong>) and add their scores together. Usually, you also add one of your Stat scores to this total. The move will look something like <em><strong>roll+Intense</strong></em> or maybe <em><strong>roll+Daring</strong></em> etc. Every possible result is then expressed following these guidelines:</p><ul><li>If the total score is <strong>10 or more</strong>, that’s a <strong>major Boon</strong></li></ul><p>The move will tell you what happens, and usually it will be a clean success with no drawbacks, or a better version of what you can normally achieve.</p><ul><li>If the total score is between <strong>7 and 9</strong>, that’s a <strong>minor Boon</strong></li></ul><p>The move will tell you what happens, and in most cases there will be strings attached, hard choices to make, or limited options.</p><ul><li>If the total score is <strong>6 or less</strong>, that’s a <strong>Snag</strong></li></ul><p>The move will either tell you what happens <strong>or</strong> give the World an opportunity to perform a Reaction. Your fictional action <strong>may still succeed</strong>, or not, depending on the World’s whim, but don’t count on its consequences being what you hoped for!</p><p>World Reactions and other NPC mechanics <strong>never</strong> call for a roll. <strong>The World never rolls dice</strong>.</p><hr /><h3>Stats</h3><p><strong>Protagonist Characters</strong>, and only them, have a set of four statistics (<strong>Stats</strong>) that outline a few salient elements of their persona and measure how good they are at taking advantage of them in appropriate situations.</p><ul><li>You do something <em><strong>Daring</strong></em> when you face risk and danger.</li><li>You do something <em><strong>Intense</strong></em> when you show passion and resolve.</li><li>You do something <em><strong>Knowing</strong></em> when you rely on experience and education.</li><li>You do something <em><strong>Vigilant</strong></em> when you act with sharpness and attentiveness.</li></ul><p>All your Stats have a numerical rating ranging from <strong>-1 to +3</strong>, but most will sit between <strong>0 and +1</strong>. It is very important to clarify that your Stat scores are a measure of effectiveness, not an absolute descriptor. A low score in DARING, for example, does <strong>not</strong> mean that you are meek or lacking in any way - it just means that when you try to do something in DARING situations you have less certainty, less control, over the outcome.</p><hr /><h3>Advantage &amp; Disadvantage</h3><p>Some game effects can make your character mark <strong>Advantage</strong> or <strong>Disadvantage</strong>. You can note this on your Protagonist’s sheet with small “plus” (<strong>+</strong>) and “minus” (<strong>-</strong>) signs. This means that <strong>on your next roll</strong> you don’t simply roll 2d6+Stat as usual. Instead:</p><ul><li>When you have Advantage you roll 3d6 and keep the <strong>best 2.</strong></li><li>When you have Disadvantage you roll 3d6 and keep the <strong>worst 2.</strong></li></ul><p>Dis/Advantage <strong>only lasts for one roll</strong>, after which <strong>all</strong> Dis/Advantage marks are considered spent and gone.</p><h4>Addition of Dis/Adv</h4><p>Dis/Advantage is a binary condition: you either have it or you don’t. If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage marks at the same time they <strong>cancel each other out</strong> on a one-to-one basis until only one, or none, remain.</p><blockquote><p>A PC is targeted by different Dis/Advantage effects all at the same time.</p><p>In total these amount to three Advantages and one Disadvantage.</p><p>On their next roll, the PC will simply roll with Advantage.</p><p>That's because one Adv. and one Disadv. cancel each other out, leaving two leftover Advantage effects.</p><p>(3 - 1 = 2)</p><p>Two or more Adv. are the same as just one, as they simply mean that YES, the PC has Advantage.</p><p>When the time comes, the PC will roll 3d6 and keep the best two.</p><p>After the roll is done, all Dis/Adv. effects cease to persist and reset to zero.</p></blockquote><h4>Conditional Dis/Adv</h4><p>Special rules and effects can describe a Dis/Advantage as applying to <strong>a specific move or circumstance</strong>. In this case, the Dis/Advantage will <strong>not</strong> be applied to just any roll, but only on the next roll that fits the specified criteria.</p><blockquote><p>The Look Around move gives you Advantage on the next roll that leverages the answers the move has generated. A roll triggered by an action that doesn't leverage such answers will not benefit from, nor consume, the Advantage.</p><p>The move Arcana Unearthed gives you ongoing Disadvantage but only on rolls to cast spells when missing your spell record. Any other roll will be unaffected.</p></blockquote><h4>Ongoing Dis/Adv</h4><p>Special rules and effects can describe a Dis/Advantage as applying to <strong>more than one roll</strong>. By the same token, a Dis/Advantage could be described as <strong>ongoing</strong>; this means that it applies to all rolls, or all rolls of a specific move/circumstance until some stop-condition is met.</p><blockquote><p>The Tactician move gives you Advantage on the next two rolls made leveraging the answers it generated.</p><p>Doppelgänger's Dance gives you Disadvantage on all rolls as long as you suppress your Tell.</p></blockquote><h4>Sources of Dis/Advantage</h4><p>Dis/Advantage is not something that can happen on a whim because a situation looks dis/advantageous to someone. Instead, it can only come from the following sources:</p><ul><li>A move grants Dis/Advantage.</li><li>A <em>World Reaction</em> inflicts Disadvantage.</li><li>A Protagonist acts in a way that either leverages (advantage) or defies (disadvantage) a Tag.</li><li>A Protagonist spends 2 XPs to gain 1 Advantage.</li></ul><p>In this regard Dis/Advantage is to be first and foremost intended as a purely abstract mechanic that more or less summarizes a galaxy of small fictional details that, as a total, put a character in a harder/easier position. There is no need to exactly “justify” what a certain Dis/Advantage looks like in the fiction.</p><p>If you roll 7-9 on a <em><strong>Take a Risk</strong></em> move and elect to suffer Disadvantage, that’s it. Don’t bend over backward to make the fiction represent this little bit of mechanics.<br />There is no direct connection.<br />And the same is true the other way around: if a situation looks dire, difficult, and problematic it is NOT a valid cause to apply a Disadvantage effect. Such fiction could inspire the World to use a Reaction that applies a Disadvantage, but only if the World is allowed to perform a Reaction to begin with.</p><h4>NPC and Dis/Advantage</h4><p>Non-Protagonist Characters have no Stats and never roll dice, so how does it work when an effect gives them Dis/Advantage?</p><p><strong>Fictional positioning...</strong> once more, with feeling.</p><p>During play, the World will constantly be required to make judgment calls about \"what happens\" in the game when Protagonists are not making moves. On all these occasions the World can look at the presence of Dis/Advantage as a clear guideline.</p><p>An NPC with Advantage <strong>will simply succeed</strong> at what they were attempting to do. An NPC with Disadvantage <strong>will simply fail</strong>. Likewise, an NPC with Advantage will feel emboldened into action, while one with Disadvantage may opt to bide their time. NPCs affected by Dis/Advantage are also an easy bargaining chip to fuel some <em>World Reactions</em>: your henchman is struggling, will you drop what you're doing to help them? Your henchman is doing fine, will you seize this opportunity to act? etc.</p><p>It's a <strong>powerful</strong> and effective way to cut through the noise of a thousand small decisions that would otherwise <strong>tire</strong> the World. This will become clearer in <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/fantasyworldrpg/the-world\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/fantasyworldrpg/the-world\" target=\"_blank\">The World</a> chapter, as it is dedicated to explaining how to play the role of World, offering many other tools to support and help them before, during, and after active play.</p><hr /><h2>2.4 - Elements of a Protagonist</h2><h3>Classes</h3><p>It is not yet time to think about the specifics of the <strong>Protagonist Characters</strong> you will be going to play, but since I'll be mentioning a few technical terms in the following text, it is important for you to have at least a vague idea of what I'm talking about.</p><p><strong>Protagonists are people</strong>.</p><p>They are capable of doing most anything that a normal person could do. Talk, fight, move around, perceive, know stuff, socialise, learn, sing, dance, paint, etc. They might not be masters at everything, but they can usually make do. Additionally, each PC embodies an <strong>iconic fantasy adventurer archetype</strong>, granting them access to special traits and abilities. This iconic role is what the game calls a Class.</p><p>In <em>Fantasy World</em> each Class is <strong>unique</strong>.</p><p>Surely the world is full of adventurers, magicians, and soldiers, but in the course of <strong>this</strong> story, only <strong>one</strong> Protagonist will embody the archetypal traits of the iconic Troubadour. Thus no two Players can pick the same Class when the time comes to do so. Here is a quick overview of the 10 available Classes:</p><ul><li><strong>Captain</strong> - <em>A capable leader at the head of a resourceful crew, facing dangers and voyages together as one.</em></li><li><strong>Knight</strong> - <em>A bastion of virtue, bestowing guidance, judgment and retribution upon an imperfect world.</em></li><li><strong>Maker</strong> - <em>A creative mind who thinks outside of the box, taking on the world armed with curiosity, knowledge, and technology.</em></li><li><strong>Occultist</strong> - <em>A practitioner of arcane arts, keeper of forgotten knowledge, and wielder of sorcerous powers.</em></li><li><strong>Priest</strong> - <em>A worker of miracles, wielding the power of religious faith and fervor.</em></li><li><strong>Scoundrel</strong> - <em>A criminal by trade and an adventurer by vocation: resourceful, connected, dangerous.</em></li><li><strong>Troubadour</strong> - <em>A w<strong>A</strong>nderer and a w<strong>O</strong>nderer, shaping the world with their art and wiles.</em></li><li><strong>Veteran</strong> - <em>A battle-seasoned fighter, bearing the wisdom earned in the face of Death and adversity.</em></li><li><strong>Wayfarer</strong> - <em>A true explorer, using their expertise of plant and beast to journey through wilderness and cities alike.</em></li><li><strong>Wildcaller</strong> - <em>A child of the land, linked inextricably to its elements and spirits.</em></li></ul><h3>Harm and Healing</h3><p>When characters, be they PCs or NPCs, get physically hurt they suffer concrete in-fiction consequences represented by lists of effects organized into three categories: <strong>Temp</strong>, <strong>Serious</strong> or <strong>Deadly</strong>. Harm is <strong>always descriptive</strong>, meaning that you look at the fiction and <strong>that</strong> tells you which harm effect to mark on the character sheet. If the appropriate effect is already marked, then the harm worsens. This can lead to suffering <strong>Deadly</strong> harm right from the get-go, or bit by bit, as small ailments pile up.</p><p>Protagonist Characters, being protagonists, get a few precious <strong>Hardiness Points</strong> (<strong>HPs</strong>) to save their necks on dire occasions. These are hard to come by though (see <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em> move) so spend them with caution!</p><p><strong>Temp</strong> harm is situational and goes away when you get back on your feet or have a good rest. But <strong>Serious</strong> and <strong>Deadly</strong> injuries are always difficult to recover from, requiring time, effort, and resources. More detailed rules for both harm and healing are explained in the <strong>Fictional Harm System</strong> section of these rules (chapter 2 section 5).</p><hr /><h3>Growth</h3><p>Protagonists are not meant to be played forever.</p><p>Protagonists are not meant to start the game as fully fleshed and monolithic, with no drive for change.</p><p>Protagonists are not meant to grow only in the sense of gaining access to increasing power.</p><p><em>Fantasy World</em> Protagonists will instead live through an <strong>emergent story arch</strong>, giving their Players a chance to <strong>get to know</strong> them, to see them <strong>change</strong>, and to find a <strong>satisfying end</strong> to their adventurous journeys. In this perspective, Protagonist growth is simply a way to gauge how far the character has come in their own personal storyline from the moment that active play started. To represent this, there are two ways in which your PC can grow:</p><h4>Expedience Points</h4><p>In the <strong>short term</strong> your PC earns <strong>1</strong> <strong>Expedience Point</strong> (<strong>XP</strong>) every time a move roll scores a Snag (1-6) or when a move effect explicitly says so.</p><p>A <strong>maximum of 10 XPs</strong> can be stored at any time, with excess points being <strong>lost</strong>.</p><p>XPs can be spent in a variety of helpful ways:</p><ul><li><strong>1 XP</strong> during the <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em> move to perform additional <em><strong>Utility</strong></em> actions.</li><li><strong>2 XP</strong> <em>before</em> a roll to mark <strong>Advantage</strong>; do this multiple times to offset multiple <strong>Disadvantages.</strong></li><li><strong>5 XP</strong> during the <em><strong>End of Session</strong></em> move to mark <strong>1 Growth.</strong></li></ul><h4>Growth Marks</h4><p>In the <strong>long term</strong> your PC accumulates Growth marks.</p><p>During the <em><strong>End of Session</strong></em> move you check if you got any marks and, at the end of it, you can spend <strong>5 Growth</strong> marks to select <strong>1 Growth Option</strong> from those available on your Class Playbook.</p><p>You are allowed to acquire only <strong>one</strong> Growth Option per session.</p><p>Growth marks can come from any of three sources: your <strong>Issue</strong>, your <strong>Doubt</strong>, and your <strong>Expedience</strong>. Keep an eye on them during active play! But do not stress over them, as Growth always happens as part of the <em><strong>End of Session</strong></em> move, where a brief checklist will help you review the game session that just ended, looking for Growth markers.</p><h4>Growth Options</h4><p>When your Protagonist accrues <strong>5 Growth marks,</strong> you get to select 1 of the available options present in their Class Playbook. These are standard for all Protagonists.</p><ul><li>Up to 3 times: increase a Stat by +1, to a max total rating of +3.</li><li>Up to 3 times: select a Growth move from <strong>your</strong> Class list.</li><li>Up to 2 times: select a Growth move from your own <strong>or a different</strong> Class list.</li><li>Up to 2 times: increase your current and max HPs by +1.</li></ul><p>These amount to a total of 10 Growth options. But <strong>after the fifth</strong> option has been selected, a new set of options is added to the basic one. These are still Growth options, but for clarity I call them <strong>Closure</strong> options:</p><ul><li><strong>Change the World</strong></li></ul><p>One feature of the setting has changed as a consequence of the Fellowship’s in/direct actions and <strong>you</strong> get to tell the World about it! This could be anything, from the life of a single person to the fate of a nation, to a shift in the very fabric of reality. Your story is <strong>not over yet</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Seize Your Destiny</strong></li></ul><p>Your PC becomes a powerful and influential <strong>NPC</strong>. You get to briefly narrate what this means and how it happens. In any case, <strong>they are still in play</strong> and the World can make use of them just like any other NPC, but they need <strong>your explicit consent</strong> if they want to substantially change or harm them.</p><ul><li><strong>Enter the Legend</strong></li></ul><p>Your PC becomes a mysterious and legendary <strong>NPC</strong>. You get to briefly narrate what this means and how it happens. In any case, <strong>they are no longer in play</strong> and the World is forbidden from using them as NPCs or from substantially changing the narrative around their legend unless they have <strong>your explicit consent</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Pass On The Torch</strong></li></ul><p>Your PC exits the stage in a relatively quiet way, becoming an <strong>NPC</strong>. But someone new steps forward as their heir! Create a fresh new Protagonist with <strong>one Growth option</strong> already marked to represent the teachings/inheritance left them by your old PC. Like in <em>Seize Your Destiny</em> you get to describe how this happens, and your old character <strong>is in play as an NPC</strong> for the World to use, but they need <strong>your consent</strong> to change or harm them substantially.</p><p>All these options allow you to give a meaningful and possibly epic culmination to your Protagonist’s story by granting you <strong>a lot</strong> of narrative power. Don’t be afraid of it! Stick to the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em>, rely on your fellow Players for guidance and advice, and all will be fine.</p><p>Notice that your PC’s adventure might <strong>spontaneously end before their 5th Growth</strong>. They could die, conclude a satisfying story arc, or choose to follow their heart/destiny away from the Fellowship. This can happen, and it is fine. The rules simply nudge your attention toward the possibility of a Closure after the 5th Growth and only really force your hand upon reaching the 12th Growth, when every available Growth option has been used up.</p><hr /><h2>2.5 - Fictional Harm System</h2><p>The term harm stands for all sorts of physical damage, hurt, and injury that can befall a character, whether they are a Player’s PC or a World’s NPC. Harm can come in <strong>three levels</strong> of increasing gravity: <strong>Temp</strong>, <strong>Serious</strong> and <strong>Deadly</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Temp</strong> harm means pain, superficial damage, or circumstantial hindrance.</li><li><strong>Serious</strong> harm means broken bones or deep wounds.</li><li><strong>Deadly</strong> harm means damage so critical or extensive that it will kill you, sooner or later.</li></ul><p>All harm effects are <strong>purely fictional</strong>. They force characters to face obstacles, limitations, and problems. This leads to the activation of moves, bringing forth consequences, costs, and hard choices. As already explained, <strong>fictional positioning</strong> is the real engine of the game, the root of the activation and operation of all other mechanics.</p><p>In this sense, it is important to note that damage is both <strong>descriptive</strong> and <strong>prescriptive</strong> in nature. Let me explain what this means:</p><h3>Descriptive harm</h3><p>If a character is <strong>described</strong> as suffering wounds or damage or conditions that <strong>look like</strong> one particular level of harm, then mechanically <strong>it is</strong> harm of that level. The fiction, the description, becomes a mechanical game effect.</p><blockquote><p>World - You fall from a first story window, landing hard on your ass. It's Temp harm!</p><p>World - You fall from a second story window, and something in you goes CRACK. It's Serious harm!</p><p>World - You fall from a third story window, and you go SQUISH. It's Deadly harm!</p></blockquote><h3>Prescriptive harm</h3><p>If a game mechanic causes harm of a certain level then the fiction <strong>must</strong> represent it through a suitable description.</p><blockquote><p>World - So you punch a guard in the face... it's Temp harm... their nose starts bleeding copiously.</p><p>Veteran - Wait, as a result of my Brawl move I get to pick one option, and I choose to inflict Terrible harm. [see section on harm Modifiers]</p><p>World - Right, so this becomes Serious harm. Then their nose bleeds AND they break a couple of teeth. The guard looks at you with a mix of stupor and rage yelling \"You baFtard! You ruined my beauFiful Fmile!!!\"</p></blockquote><h3>Harm Effects</h3><p>Each level of harm is represented in practice by a list of <strong>specific effects</strong>. The level alone is meaningless, as it is just a way to easily organize information. The list of effects is what really matters.</p><p><strong>Temp</strong> harm means pain, flesh wounds, or circumstantial hindrance:</p><blockquote><p><strong>☐</strong> You <strong>look and feel</strong> like a mess: bloody, bruised, and torn up.<br /><strong>☐</strong> You <strong>lose hold of something</strong> important you were carrying or wearing.<br /><strong>☐</strong> You <strong>lose footing</strong> or end up in a <strong>problematic position.</strong><br /><strong>☐</strong> You are <strong>held</strong> by something that clutches/tangles/impedes you.<br /><strong>☐</strong> You are <strong>out cold</strong>, unconscious or powerless until the World says otherwise.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Serious</strong> harm means broken bones or deep wounds:</p><blockquote><p><strong>☐</strong> An <strong>open and vicious gash</strong> that, after healing, will leave a <strong>permanent scar</strong> (make a Tag of this).<br /><strong>☐</strong> You are actively <strong>impeded</strong> by pain and injury in doing anything requiring effort or strain.<br /><strong>☐</strong> You <strong>broke</strong> or <strong>mangled</strong> one or more of your limbs, which are now <strong>inoperable.</strong><br /><strong>☐</strong> One of your eyes or ears is <strong>ruined</strong>, forever <strong>hampering</strong> your senses (make a Tag of this).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Deadly</strong> harm means critical or extensive damage:</p><blockquote><p><strong>☐</strong> Your condition is bad and will develop complications; <strong>you will die</strong> within a few days.<br /><strong>☐</strong> Your condition deteriorates rapidly; <strong>you will die</strong> within a few hours.<br /><strong>☐</strong> Your heart stops beating; <strong>you are dead</strong> or <strong>will die</strong> in a matter of seconds.</p></blockquote><h3>From Level to Effect</h3><blockquote><p>Harm Hierarchy</p><p>Temp &gt;&gt;&gt; Serious &gt;&gt;&gt; Deadly</p></blockquote><p>Saying that a character suffers <strong>Temp</strong>, <strong>Serious</strong> or <strong>Deadly</strong> harm is an indication of the overall <strong>level</strong> of harm that they suffer. But then each level actually translates into <strong>one or more</strong> specific <strong>effects</strong> that need to be tracked on the character's sheet:</p><ul><li><strong>Temp</strong> harm inflicts a total of <strong>1</strong> effect: one <strong>Temp</strong> effect.</li><li><strong>Serious</strong> harm inflicts a total of <strong>2</strong> effects: one <strong>Temp</strong> and one <strong>Serious</strong> effect.</li><li><strong>Deadly</strong> harm inflicts a total of <strong>3</strong> effects: one <strong>Temp</strong> and one <strong>Serious</strong> and one <strong>Deadly</strong> effect.</li></ul><h4>How to mark harm Effects</h4><p>There is an empty <strong>box</strong> assigned to each harm effect.</p><p>When an effect is suffered, the corresponding box must be <strong>marked</strong>.</p><p>You can only mark a harm effect if it is both <strong>unmarked</strong> <em>AND</em> <strong>fictionally appropriate</strong>. What does this mean?</p><p>It means that you must always mark effects following the <em><strong>Temp &gt;&gt;&gt; Serious &gt;&gt;&gt; Deadly</strong></em> order. This is very important because of how the mechanics work when you can't mark an effect (explained soon).</p><blockquote><p>Unmarked</p><p>By default, harm effects are not marked. During the game, they get marked when you suffer harm. You can eventually un-mark them by \"healing\" individual effects as explained in the Health &amp; Healing section.</p><p>Fictionally Appropriate</p><p>It's usually obvious if a given effect is fitting to the circumstances being described. When in doubt, the Players can add a few details to the description to make one effect fit better. Adding more details is not the same as retconning what was already described, which is not possible in this case.</p><p>If the fiction does not fit the selected effect, then that effect can't be marked and a different or worse one must be chosen. In case of disagreement, the One Golden Rule is the go-to solution.</p></blockquote><h4>Who Chooses?</h4><blockquote><p>The \"victim\" chooses the specific effects.</p></blockquote><p>Often a given description could reasonably fit different harm effects. Who decides which ones to mark? <strong>The victim</strong>. It is always the owner of the character suffering harm who chooses which harm effects to mark. This means that the Players decide for their own Protagonist character, and the World decides for all the Non-Protagonist characters.</p><blockquote><p>World - The ogre swings his heavy mace at you with a vertical motion, from up to down, hitting you with bone-crushing power. It's Serious harm!</p><p>Veteran - I try to parry with my shield. And I guess that... [going through the Temp list] ...the blow literally crushes me to the ground, putting me in a problematic position with my ass on the floor and... [going through the Serious list] ...my shield arm is broken. Ouch!</p></blockquote><p>How the World estimated that the harm in this example was <strong>Serious</strong> will be explained in the harm <em><strong>Adjudication</strong></em> section.</p><h4>Who Describes?</h4><blockquote><p>It is not the World's place to describe how your PC comically falls on their ass.</p></blockquote><p>Usually the events and descriptions leading up to the suffering of harm are enough to clarify the situation. What is going on? And how? And why? We described it already, so just name and mark the appropriate harm effects and let's move on.</p><p>But when this is not the case, when a few additional details are required to clear the situation, then it is <strong>the Player’s job</strong> to describe how the effects happen. Obviously, they can rely on others, asking for help or inspiration when describing harm feels difficult or unsavory. And about that: how graphic and detailed the violence is depends on the sensitivity of the table. The <em><strong>One</strong></em> <em><strong>Golden Rule</strong></em> helps with this too, so use it.</p><blockquote><p>Veteran - So I punch the guard and she punches me back. It's Temp, right? Then I mark the held effect.</p><p>World - Err, sorry but how does this fit? How is a straight punch going to \"hold\" you?</p><p>Veteran - Maybe during our exchange we end up brawling on the ground, and she is on top of me, holding me down while punching? [the Player adds details to make the effect fit in the fiction]</p><p>World - Yeah, why not, that makes sense.</p><p>or</p><p>World - That's not what my NPC goes for. She is expertly boxing, and right now she delivered a clean punch.</p><p>Describing Other People's Stuff</p><p>In this example, the Player's additional details involve describing how another character behaves.</p><p>The owner of that character has the authority to accept or reject such a description.</p><p>Granting more or less leeway in these matters is one way...</p><p>For Players to one-up each other into cool descriptions.</p><p>For the World to manipulate the overall difficulty level of the game.</p></blockquote><h4>What if you can't mark an effect?</h4><p>What happens when a character suffers a certain level of harm but none of the associated effects are available to be marked? This could happen because the fitting effects are already marked, but also because the fiction somehow doesn’t seem to fit any of them.</p><p>In these cases, a different effect <strong>from a worse level</strong> must be marked.</p><p>This can <strong>cascade</strong>. So a <strong>Temp</strong> effect that is not possible to mark will become <strong>Serious</strong>; but then, if it is also not possible to mark it as a <strong>Serious</strong> effect, it becomes <strong>Deadly</strong>.</p><p>A Player can always <strong>voluntarily</strong> elect to mark a worse effect, provided the new effect is both unmarked and fitting. This comes in handy when a milder effect would be, for situational reasons, less desirable than a harsher but more manageable one.</p><blockquote><p>A Protagonist is crawling on the floor in order to sneak past a nearby soldier post. Unfortunately, a guardian falcon sees them and attacks, landing a swooping claw slash from above, hit-and-run style. All things considered, this should inflict just Temp harm. But...</p><p>Because of previous misadventures the PC already looks messy.</p><p>At the moment they are not holding anything of importance that could be dropped or lost.</p><p>Being already prone and crawling the PC can't really lose footing.</p><p>The falcon attack is a hit-and-go, nothing that could hold the PC.</p><p>A falcon gashing your back is surely painful, but maybe not enough to make you lose consciousness.</p><p>The only option left is to be put in a problematic position, as the falcon attack might in and of itself alert the soldiers or force the PC to make a sudden noise or movement, to the same effect.</p><p>But the Player really wants to successfully sneak past the soldiers, so they choose to upgrade this one effect from Temp to Serious, ending up describing how the falcon's claws inflict an open and vicious gash on the Protagonist's back that will later on result in a long-lasting scar.</p></blockquote><h3>Harm Adjudication</h3><blockquote><p>The ONE question</p><p>All things considered, is this harm Temp, Serious or outright Deadly?</p></blockquote><p>Harm is relative. There is no one list that can universally establish that a sword always inflicts X amount of harm. Instead, harm <strong>depends on the fiction</strong> and its circumstances. This means that a multitude of factors could be important:</p><ul><li>Size, weight, shape, and quality of the attack weapon.</li><li>Style, speed and skill of the attack action.</li><li>How vital and vulnerable is the area being targeted.</li><li>All of the above considerations are also valid for armor and defence.</li><li>Then any number of environmental circumstances could be relevant (visibility, wind, etc).</li></ul><p>Painstakingly crunching all these details into numbers to then work them into calculations is... <strong>not</strong> the way to go.</p><p>Instead, <em>Fantasy World</em> relies on the World and Players to simply <strong>glance at the fiction</strong> as a whole, from a <strong>bird’s eye</strong> perspective, and then make a <strong>broad eyeball judgment</strong> to answer a single question:</p><p><em>All things considered, is this harm Temp, Serious or outright Deadly?</em></p><p>Most of the time this judgment call takes only a moment as the answer is <strong>obvious</strong>, but in case of doubt, looking at the Tags relevant to the situation can be of help, then reviewing the harm level descriptions and the lists of effects helps too. In the rare cases when there is no clear and unanimous evaluation, the World acts as the final arbiter and tiebreaker.</p><blockquote><p>A drunk man lazily swinging a fork in your PCs general direction is a pretty tame threat. If he were to hit them, the harm would probably be just Temp, if any at all. A skilled assassin driving that same fork in your PC's eyeball would easily be Serious or Deadly harm.</p><p>A punch from a human can be a Temp affair. A punch from a gorilla is surely a more Serious thing. A punch from a giant is Deadly as it will simply make your PC go \"squish\".</p><p>A sting from a wasp might not inflict any harm, but ending up in the middle of a swarm of angry wasps could initially be Temp and then degenerate to Serious or even escalate to Deadly depending on the circumstances.</p></blockquote><h4>Harm Modifiers</h4><p>Most of the time the game will mention harm “<strong>as established</strong>”. Harm as established is the harm that would be inflicted depending on what the fiction looks like: if it <strong>looks like</strong> <strong>Serious</strong> harm, then <strong>it is</strong> <strong>Serious</strong> harm. Then some moves and game mechanics refer to <strong>Terrible</strong> or <strong>Little</strong> harm.</p><p><strong>Terrible</strong> means one <strong>level above</strong> as established: for example if it looks like <strong>Serious</strong> harm, then it becomes <strong>Deadly</strong> harm.</p><p><em>No harm &gt;&gt;&gt; Temp &gt;&gt;&gt; Serious &gt;&gt;&gt; Deadly</em></p><p><strong>Little</strong> means one <strong>level below</strong> as established: so if it looks like <strong>Serious</strong> harm, then it becomes Temp.</p><p><em>Deadly &gt;&gt;&gt; Serious &gt;&gt;&gt; Temp &gt;&gt;&gt; No harm</em></p><h4>No harm</h4><p>An important thing to notice is that <strong>Temp</strong> is not the least harm possible. <strong>No harm</strong> is the least harm possible, and there are plenty of situations when an attack would simply not be able to inflict any harm at all.</p><blockquote><p>A human knight swinging a broadsword at an unarmored peasant might cause Deadly harm.</p><p>The same attack against a trained and equipped opponent might result in Serious harm.</p><p>The same attack against a tree-man made of solid wood-flesh might cause Temp harm at best.</p><p>A stone golem will suffer No harm at all, as the sword would barely scratch its rocky skin no matter how much strength the knight can put into the swing.</p></blockquote><h4>Multiple harms</h4><p>By the same token, a single source of harm could easily affect <strong>more than one target</strong>, and then cause <strong>different levels</strong> of harm to each.</p><blockquote><p>A rock falling on a group of characters will inflict harm to all of them. But then each character might suffer different levels of harm depending on how directly the rock falls on them, on their (un)timely Reactions, on their personal armor, etc.</p></blockquote><hr /><h3>Hardiness</h3><p><strong>Hardiness Points</strong> (<strong>HP</strong>) represent a character’s proclivity to survive either through skill, expertise, resilience, or sheer luck. They can be spent when harm is suffered <strong>before</strong> any effect is selected, to lower the overall harm <strong>level</strong> on a one-to-one basis.</p><p><em>Spend 1HP to reduce harm by one level: Deadly &gt;&gt;&gt; Serious &gt;&gt;&gt; Temp &gt;&gt;&gt; No harm</em></p><blockquote><p>A Protagonist is badly wounded and should face Deadly harm.</p><p>By spending one HP they can turn it into Serious harm.</p><p>By spending a second HP they can reduce the harm to just Temp level.</p><p>A third HP will allow them to avoid any harm whatsoever.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Only PCs</strong> have Hardiness. NPC can never be protected in this way.</p><p>The maximum amount of HPs a Protagonist can have is equal to <strong>1</strong> plus any additional points bought through specific Growth options:</p><p><em>1 + Growths</em></p><p>When harm is reduced by HPs, the Player is required to <strong>describe how</strong> this looks in the fiction. Was the PC parrying and dodging? Was the PC carrying a small book just where the arrow hit them? Was the PC’s determination stronger than the pain?</p><p>Feel free to represent your HP expenditure however you like. Hardiness is “<strong>dramatic protection</strong>” granted to the Protagonists of an adventurous story, so don’t overthink it, but don't ignore it either.</p><p>Spent HPs can only be regained by using the <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em> move. By devoting time and resources to regaining your oomph and chutzpah, you will be able to restore <strong>1 HP</strong>.</p><hr /><h3>Health &amp; Healing</h3><p>In <em>Fantasy World</em> healing is possible, but never easy or instantaneous. Harm left unattended <strong>can</strong> and <strong>will</strong> worsen whenever the circumstances guide the World towards using their Reactions to <em>Inflict Harm</em>. To prevent this, Protagonists and NPCs need to invest actions, effort, time, and resources to recuperate lost health and mend wounds. <strong>Instantaneous and effortless healing is, by design, </strong><em><strong>impossible</strong></em>. This deliberate choice is meant to foster and support the tone, mood, and core themes of the Dramatic Fantasy genre and should not be tampered with. Wondrous and miraculous remedies might exist in your fantastical stories, offering salvation from most grievous ailments and even certain death, but they should <strong>never be commonplace, trivial, or readily available</strong>.</p><h4>Temp Healing</h4><p><strong>Temp</strong> harm is meant to be <strong>circumstantial</strong> and <strong>transient</strong>, and it very rarely gets worse over time.</p><p>Describing simple actions can easily fix the <strong>fictional effect</strong> of <strong>Temp</strong> harm. If you have fallen, stand up. If you look like a mess, clean yourself up. These actions are usually trivial but could become difficult or even dangerous to perform depending on the situation.</p><p>On the other hand, the <strong>mark</strong> noted on the Class Playbook when a <strong>Temp</strong> effect is first suffered will stay there <strong>until the end of the tense/dangerous situation</strong> that generated it. This means that the use of violence can easily build up to serious consequences!</p><blockquote><p>Serban, a mercenary having a drink in a tavern, gets forcefully shoved backward. Given the circumstances, his Player opts to describe how Serban loses his footing. Fictionally Serban falls down on his ass, while mechanically the Player marks the eponymous Temp effect.</p><p>A few moments later, Serban gets back up on his feet. Assuming there are no obstacles or dangers standing in the way of this action, it is sufficient for the Player to describe Serban as he does so.</p><p>The scuffle in the tavern continues and someone performs a sweeping kick against Serban. The obvious option would be to see Serban landing on his ass on the floor a second time, but the loses his footing Temp effect is already marked, so his Player is forced to choose: either mark a different Temp effect that fits the fiction or mark a Serious effect that also fits the fiction.</p><p>Serban is holding a dagger in his right hand, so his Player could opt for the lose hold of something effect. If this were the case, they could describe it in many ways because the fiction so far only suggests that Serban might lose footing, but does not really show it, while mechanically the thing that has to happen is the loss of the dagger:</p><p>Serban might almost fall but ultimately keep his balance, albeit at the price of losing the dagger.</p><p>Serban might fall down but immediately bounce back up with an agile tumble, unfortunately losing hold of the dagger in the process.</p><p>Serban might fall down and in doing so, lose grip of his dagger, or be disarmed while on the ground. Sometimes the fiction just makes more sense in a certain way, or the Player is unable or unwilling to imagine an alternative situation. That's fine too.</p></blockquote><h4>Serious Healing</h4><p><strong>Serious</strong> harm is long-lasting and can degenerate badly.</p><p>Its healing requires dedicated medical attention in the form of time, effort, skill, and supplies. These are all represented in-game as <strong>Healing Units</strong>. Each HU you receive is applied to <strong>one specific harm effect</strong> and it takes <strong>3 HU</strong> to heal (unmark) one <strong>Serious</strong> effect.</p><h4>Deadly Healing</h4><p><strong>Deadly</strong> harm is, in a way, less permanent and easier to heal than <strong>Serious</strong> harm. It only takes <strong>1 HU</strong> to heal <strong>one</strong> <strong>Deadly</strong> effect.</p><p>This is because they represent <strong>how (un)stable the PC’s health is</strong>.</p><p>Broken bones and deep cuts are represented by <strong>Serious</strong> harm effects. What <strong>Deadly</strong> harm does is add on top of that the notion that <em>\"<strong>you are going to die</strong>\"</em> ... now, soon, or in a while. Obviously, this kind of harm deteriorates very fast, and the World is encouraged to use their Reactions to keep pressure on wounded characters.</p><h4>Healing Units &amp; Time</h4><p>Healing Units can only be obtained through the <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em> move. Quick emergency treatment can inform the World and the <em>Reactions</em> they will perform by changing the fictional positioning of the wounded character, but true healing can only happen when spending extended time and resources, which is what triggers a <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em> in the first place.</p><p>In the case of <strong>prolonged downtime</strong> (a few days, a week, a month, etc) the World arbitrarily awards HUs depending on the characters’ behavior and conditions. Were they resting? Were they properly fed and treated? Was magical healing involved?</p><hr /><h3>Harm &amp; Groups</h3><p>Whenever possible, the World should handle numerous NPCs as <strong>groups</strong> rather than as individuals, especially during hectic scenes where the Protagonists are <strong>directly acting against</strong> such groups.</p><p>Groups are defined by fictional Tags highlighting their strengths and weaknesses: weapons, armor, training, morale, discipline, health, etc.</p><p>Most importantly, groups come in three different sizes:</p><ul><li>Up to 10-20 people are a <strong>Small</strong> group.</li><li>Up to 30-40 people are a <strong>Medium</strong> group.</li><li>Up to 50 people and beyond are a <strong>Large</strong> group.</li></ul><p>These numbers are just broad guidelines to help the World eyeball the size of a group. <strong>Three</strong> bandits could be enough to count as a Small group. <strong>Seventy</strong> soldiers might be handled as a single Large group or as a couple of Medium ones, or even as a bunch of Small ones. The point is: don’t get hung up on exact numbers and instead use Tags and gut feeling to guide the use of group size.</p><h4>Group Harm Effects</h4><p>Harm levels and effects for groups are more abstract than the ones for Individuals. This makes it a bit more difficult to gauge them. The trick is to imagine how the actions of <strong>the acting PC</strong> would apply to a <strong>single exemplar member</strong> of the group, then let the rules about <strong>group size</strong> (explained in the next section) modify this base value.</p><p>Depending on the fictional circumstances (and relevant Tags) a group will inflict and suffer harm following a procedure very similar to that of individual characters, only with a different list of harm effects.</p><p><strong>Temp</strong> harm to a group causes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>☐</strong> Champions to come forth and spur their comrades<br /><strong>☐</strong> Combatants to close ranks and regroup<br /><strong>☐</strong> An opening to be revealed<br /><strong>☐</strong> Many injuries, some serious<br /><strong>☐</strong> A loss in the will to keep on fighting</p></blockquote><p><strong>Serious</strong> harm to a group causes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>☐</strong> A dramatic shift in the tide of battle<br /><strong>☐</strong> An \"eye of the storm\" moment of clarity and pause<br /><strong>☐</strong> Widespread injuries, many serious, severe fatalities<br /><strong>☐</strong> A forced retreat or a radical change of strategy</p></blockquote><p><strong>Deadly</strong> harm to a group causes:</p><blockquote><p><strong>☐</strong> Leaders to abandon their comrades; the group might rout if pressured the right way<br /><strong>☐</strong> A general break in morale; the group routs in a volatile and dangerous way<br /><strong>☐</strong> A crushing defeat; the group routs in a passive and spiritless way</p></blockquote><h4>Size Matters</h4><p>When a group acts against another group of <strong>the same size</strong>, normal rules apply.</p><p>When a group is <strong>one size smaller</strong> than the other, it acts with <strong>ongoing</strong> Disadvantage and inflicts <strong>Little</strong> harm.</p><p>When a group is <strong>one size bigger</strong> than the other, it acts with <strong>ongoing</strong> Advantage and causes <strong>Terrible</strong> harm.</p><p><strong>Both</strong> conditions apply simultaneously.</p><p>When a group is <strong>two or more sizes smaller</strong> than another, it has no chance of success or survival in a <strong>direct</strong> confrontation. There are simply too many opponents to be faced <strong>openly</strong>. Only the use of some clever plan, special tool, or favorable circumstances to <strong>level the playing field</strong> or to <strong>avoid a direct clash</strong> can offer any hope of success.</p><p>Likewise, when a group is <strong>two or more sizes bigger</strong> than another, any direct and open confrontation leads to a trivially easy success. The opposition is powerless to resist your overwhelming numbers.</p><p>The general group hierarchy is:</p><p><em><strong>Individuals &lt; Small group &lt; Medium group &lt; Large group</strong></em></p><blockquote><p>NO size difference</p><p>Normal rules apply.</p><p>ONE size difference</p><p>The smaller acts with ongoing Disadvantage and inflicts Little harm.</p><p>The bigger acts with ongoing Advantage and inflicts Terrible harm.</p><p>MORE size difference</p><p>Direct confrontation results in certain doom for the smaller.</p></blockquote><h4>Protagonists &amp; Size</h4><p>In terms of group size, the <strong>Protagonists are always treated as individuals</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>A big Fellowship of five or six Protagonists will not count as a Small group.</p><p>A band of five NPCs allied with five PCs does not count as a total of 10 characters for matters of group size. Either the World judges the five NPCs as being enough to form a Small group, or they are not a group and count as individuals.</p></blockquote><p>Instead, Protagonists who are <strong>leading</strong> a group or <strong>acting in concert</strong> with it will count as using that group <strong>as a tool or weapon</strong>. When this happens, individual PC actions are performed at the group’s size.</p><p>When the PC’s group suffers group harm then the PC suffers a comparable <strong>level</strong> of individual harm too.</p><p>The opposite is <strong>not true</strong>: if the PC suffers individual harm, this does not necessarily cause harm to the rest of their group.</p><blockquote><p>If the group is harmed, the Individual is harmed too.</p><p>If the Individual is harmed, the group may or may not be harmed.</p></blockquote><h4>Examples of Group / Individual interactions</h4><blockquote><p>Veteran - How many wolves are attacking me?</p><p>World - A few... a bunch... enough to be a Small group.</p><p>Veteran - Wielding a torch in my left hand and a sword in my right hand I charge the beasts, hacking and slashing like there is no tomorrow!</p><p>World - You would normally inflict Severe harm to a lone wolf, but because of the pack's size this turns into Temp. On the other hand, a single wolf would only cause you Temp harm, but there are so many that it turns into Serious. Also, you will roll with ongoing Disadvantage. Are you sure you want to fight them head-on, in the open?</p><p>Veteran - Bring them on! This is a Brawl move, right? So I roll+DARING with Disadvantage... and I score a 9, so we exchange harm but I get to pick one option... and I choose to impress, dismay or frighten them.</p><p>World - Good. So you suffer Serious harm caused by a multitude of claw and fang attacks, while they suffer just Temp harm... but are also very impressed. You go first, what does your harm look like?</p><p>Veteran - Serious harm means first one Temp effect, then one Serious effect, right? So... at the end of a fast and furious bout of fighting, I am all torn up and covered in blood [Temp]. And also a long gash [Serious] runs vertically from my left temple to the end of my chin, bleeding and burning. And I growl at them as if I, too, were a feral animal, brandishing flame and steel in my hands.</p><p>World - Awesome! The wolves move uncomfortably in front of you as if to keep a safe distance. Some have bloody cuts from your sword. Some are still smoking from where your torch burned them...</p><p>The World thinks to itself: since the Veteran has impressed and dismayed them I would say that as damage I can mark the a loss in the will to keep on fighting group Temp effect.</p><p>...proving to be harder prey than they were expecting, so after a moment of growling back at you, they cautiously move back and then scuttle away.</p><p>Scoundrel - Me and mine are going to teach you a good lesson, Dufresne!</p><p>World - Bollocks! My gang will rip you all a new one! Come and get me if you have the guts!</p><p>Scoundrel - Chaaaaaarge!</p><p>World - So... you just attack them?</p><p>Scoundrel - Me and mine are gonna teach them a lesson with our sticks and stones, and a few choice words too.</p><p>World - Ok. Your people are a Small group of nasty street brawlers. Dufresne gang is larger, a good Medium group I would say. But they were here to relax and drink, so they lack proper weapons and armor, while your people came looking for trouble and were prepared for it. What do you do as the brawl breaks out?</p><p>Scoundrel - I search for Dufresne. I want to beat him personally.</p><p>World - Navigating through the fight is not the safest of things. Unless you do something to avoid being grabbed and beaten, you will suffer harm.</p><p>Scoundrel - I'm quick and agile, I jump on a table, I scuttle behind a chair, I grab a hanging chandelier and swing from it until I reach that ruffian.</p><p>World - How DARING! Looks like a perfect way to Take a Risk. If it was just you trying to zig-zag through their ranks it would be an impossible task, one vs a Medium group. But thanks to the support of your people it is simply a matter of Small vs Medium; you can act but at ongoing Disadvantage.</p><p>Scoundrel - Right. And my final score is... 5. Damn! What happens?</p><p>World - You do your best and manage to get very close to Dufresne, but the scene has turned into a big free-for-all brawl and suddenly a big guy appears beside you, unexpectedly landing a sound wallop with his big bare hands. One on one it would be Temp harm, but Small on Medium it becomes Serious. How does it look?</p><p>Scoundrel - It's chaos. The hit is not that bad, but it makes me lose my footing [Temp]. I fall on the floor and get trampled by a few combatants, which hurts like hell [Serious] when I hear some ribs crack.</p><p>World - As we described both groups ducking it out with each other, it makes sense to me that while you try your thing, they also exchange some harm. All modifiers considered, your people suffer Serious harm too... they look a lot less bold than they were at the beginning [Temp]. And there is this brief moment within the general chaos [Serious] when even from your prone position you notice many of them looking in your direction for guidance and support. On the other hand, Dufresne is basically at arm's reach. What do you do?</p><p>Scoundrel - I see how my people are not faring well, so for their sake I signal the retreat. \"Till next time, Dufresne!!!\"</p><p>How to World #1</p><p>At the end of this example the Scoundrel performs a move that results in a Snag.</p><p>This leaves the success or failure of the attempted action in the World's hands, plus they have a Reaction to perform.</p><p>Since the Scoundrel's description looked cool, and a confrontation with Dufresne would be interesting, the World granted them success: the Scoundrel reached their target. But then the World used the Inflict harm Reaction, a bit because it was an easy choice given the circumstances, and a bit to make the Scoundrel feel less invincible. They were looking for a big fight? Well the big fight found them, and is kicking back!</p><p>This is a good decision for many reasons.</p><p>For the game, success and forward action are almost always more interesting than failure and stasis. Now that the Scoundrel is close to their target, what will they do?</p><p>Act against the guy that is beating them down, risking losing Dufresne again?</p><p>Act against Dufresne, risking ignoring an immediate threat?</p><p>Retreat to avoid further harm to themselves and their allies?</p><p>Also, suffering harm can be harsh on the Players' morale, so by granting success the World is softening the blow and working towards establishing the experience as tough but fair.</p><p>And finally, granting success helps the World in avoiding common procedural mistakes, when describing failure in addition to the effects of a Reaction ends up inadvertently doling out multiple Reactions, which is not allowed.</p><p>World - You reach the cave entrance, but the bandits are hot on your heels. What do you do?</p><p>Veteran - Can we make our stand here? Just mow them down until there are none left?</p><p>World - There are too many of them, a Medium group, maybe 30 bandits up in arms against the three of you.</p><p>Occultist - I have ways to empower my magic so that it affects a Small group. What if I fireball them?</p><p>World - Small vs Medium works, but at a reduced effect. You can do that, but your companions are still powerless against such numbers: your scorching attack might create an opportunity for action, but if you then stay and face them you would all be overwhelmed. A direct and open confrontation of three vs thirty is just not sustainable. Do you still want to face them this way?</p><p>Wayfarer- What about the cave? If we retreat into it the cramped space should force them to fight in smaller groups, taking away the advantage of their numbers.</p><p>World - Great idea! From what you can see of the entrance, there would still be enough space for a Small group to enter and fight you, but the rest would be forced to stay out. It's still a bad situation, but it offers you a fighting chance.</p><p>How to World #2</p><p>The World is being honest, laying down the facts and the options as they see them. Nothing is certain but knowing the rules, this is probably how things would go down.</p><p>This is not meant to dissuade the Players from following the wrong course of action.</p><p>Who knows?</p><p>Maybe the fireball can be more effective than expected. Maybe the Players are more interested in seeing this desperate last stand happen than in their characters' survival.</p><p>Be honest and open, but don't push. As the World, things are fine for you however they might go down.</p></blockquote><hr /><h2>2.6 - Equipment &amp; Supplies</h2><p><em><strong>Fantasy World</strong></em> does not put a lot of emphasis on the concept of equipment unless it is somehow meaningful and iconic within the adventurous story you are experiencing. But for those times when \"stuff\" is interesting and important, there are a few rules and mechanics to help you handle it in a fun and fruitful way.</p><h3>Equipment Tags</h3><p>Important equipment such as weapons, armor and other items do not have numerical ratings attached to them. Describing them within the fiction is all that it takes to make them work with the Fantasy World rules and systems. But sometimes you might yearn for some extra details about the features and properties of a certain item: for this purpose, the game uses fictional Tags.</p><p>Attaching an endless list of Tags to an item is not a good way to use this tool. Instead, Tags are meant as <strong>highlights</strong> of particular interest and significance to the Players:</p><ul><li><p>They could highlight something obvious that Players <strong>feel the need to keep in sight</strong>, lest they forget about it.</p><ul><li>A sword obviously works best at a range that is not too close and not too far away, but writing down something like <strong>sword </strong><em><strong>[close]</strong></em> rather than <strong>knife </strong><em><strong>[hand]</strong></em> or <strong>halberd </strong><em><strong>[reach]</strong></em> helps in knowing what’s what.</li></ul></li><li><p>They could highlight what is <em><strong>different</strong></em> about an otherwise common item.</p><ul><li>A sword is a sword, but a <em><strong>[fast]</strong></em><strong> sword</strong> is faster than just a sword with no Tags, and will play differently than a <em><strong>[heavy]</strong></em> <strong>sword</strong> or a <em><strong>[sharp]</strong></em> <strong>sword</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><p>They could highlight what is <em><strong>special</strong></em> about an otherwise common item.</p><ul><li><p>A sword is a sword, but a <em><strong>[flaming]</strong></em><strong> sword</strong> does something no ordinary sword can.<br />A sword is a sword, but a <strong>sword </strong><em><strong>[close][reach]</strong></em> can somehow extend in ways that are not common. Can it turn into a segmented whip? Can it shoot energy? Can it lengthen and contract at will?</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>As previously explained in the <em><strong>Fictional Gaming</strong></em> section, anyone at any time can ask for a new Tag to be put in place, or for an obsolete one to be removed. It’s just a matter of tidying up what is already part of the fiction so that it becomes easier to toy around with it.</p><p>Some Tags have an <strong>obvious meaning</strong>:</p><p><em><strong>[loud]</strong></em> - it produces a lot of noise. <em><strong>[silent]</strong></em> - it produces little noise. <em><strong>[fast]</strong></em> - it is quite fast to use. <em><strong>[slow]</strong></em> - it is quite slow to use. <em><strong>[sharp]</strong></em> - it is quite good for cutting. <em><strong>[blunt]</strong></em> - it is quite good for bashing. <em><strong>[heavy]</strong></em> - it is quite heavy. <em><strong>[light]</strong></em> - it is quite light. <em><strong>[poisoned]</strong></em> - it is coated in poison.</p><p>Other Tags represent a mix of attributes, to highlight an overall <strong>final effect</strong>:</p><p><em><strong>[messy]</strong></em> - it makes a gory mess. <em><strong>[forceful]</strong></em>- it applies a lot of force to the target, possibly blowing them away. <em><strong>[reload]</strong></em>- it needs time and effort to be reloaded after every use.</p><p>Other Tags represent <strong>special features</strong> that are less obviously tangible:</p><p><strong>[ectoplasmic]</strong> - it can hurt ghosts and spirits. <strong>[of gloom]</strong> - it devours joy and hope. <strong>[beautiful]</strong> - it really is a strikingly beautiful item.</p><p>Other Tags express <strong>technical details</strong> such as effective range:</p><p><em><strong>[hand]</strong></em> - target is within arm’s reach <em><strong>[close]</strong></em> - target is just beyond Hand range <em><strong>[reach]</strong></em> - target is just beyond Close range <em><strong>[near]</strong></em> - target is anywhere beyond Reach range and within shouting distance <em><strong>[far]</strong></em> - target is anywhere beyond Near range within sight</p><blockquote><p>Hand &gt;&gt; Close &gt;&gt; Reach &gt;&gt; Near &gt;&gt; Far</p><p>These measurements are intentionally vague and approximate, referring more to the physical description of the acting character than to specific distances.</p><p>The first three (Hand, Close, and Reach) are pretty much the same thing in that they describe an area of a few meters around the acting character. Anyone could move from one to the other with a few steps or a dash. But in tense moments (like combat) even small differences can be significant. These Tags exist to take advantage of them if your group needs or cares to use them. Another way to summarize all three would be the \"Here\" range.</p><p>The last two (Near and Far) represent much larger, but equally vague, distances. How far does shouting reach? How far can one see? If environmental elements change the character's ability to shout or see, does that affect range too? These and other questions can only be answered as you play, depending on the specific fictional situation.</p></blockquote><p>Most of the time <strong>you won't need any of these Tags</strong>. When everyone at the table is familiar with the items described and knows what to expect, you are already good to go. But if the need ever arises, then the Tags system is there for you. Just define the Tags you need on the spot, ask if everyone is ok with that, and move on.</p><blockquote><p>Player - My sword is finely crafted, so in a duel shouldn't it be better than the hunk of metal my opponent brandishes?</p><p>World - Maybe. What makes it suited for dueling?</p><p>Player - It's light, fast, agile!</p><p>World - Cool, why don't you surmise it all as a [dueling] Tag and write it down so we can remember it? But you said it right... your opponent's sword is a brutish hunk of metal, so I'll Tag it as [heavy] so everyone knows that.</p><p>Player - Ohhh then I better not try and parry it with my delicate weapon!</p><p>Some example items and their possible Tags:</p><p>Sword [close]</p><p>Dagger [close][fast]</p><p>War Hammer [close][slow][heavy][forceful]</p><p>Plate Armor [cumbersome][heavy][loud]</p><p>Spell Book [ornate][heavy][cursed]</p></blockquote><hr /><h3>Supplies</h3><p>Supplies are a meter that represents relatively <strong>small</strong> and <strong>common</strong> and <strong>cheap</strong> items such as food, medicaments, arcane ingredients, ammunition, small utility tools, torches, etc. You don't track the quantity of each of these things. Instead, they are all assumed to be available to you, all being part of each PC's level of Supplies. Players individually track their PC's level of Supplies by increasing them...</p><blockquote><p>from Run Out --&gt; to Few --&gt; to Enough --&gt; to Plenty</p></blockquote><p>or by decreasing them...</p><blockquote><p>from Plenty --&gt; to Enough --&gt; to Few --&gt; to Run Out</p></blockquote><p>For this reason Supplies are functionally infinite and weightless until they <em><strong>Run Out</strong></em>, at which point you have no more Supplies and you need to somehow restock them before they can be used/spent again.</p><p>Describing the use of your Supplies does <strong>not</strong> consume them. If you light a torch you <strong>don't</strong> need to decrease your Supplies level. By the same token, the World is <strong>not</strong> allowed to arbitrarily reduce or increase your Supplies level.</p><p>This works in the other direction too. The purchase of common goods and amenities is uninteresting so, as long as you have some level of Supplies, you are assumed to have more or less effortless access to all the small common things you might need. Likewise, the purchase of similar items happens thanks to the money and goods your Supplies level <strong>implies</strong> you have. Yes, Supplies are themselves a fictional Tag with some extra rules sprinkled on top.</p><p>The only way to affect the actual level of Supplies is through the effect of <em><strong>moves</strong></em> and <em><strong>Reactions</strong></em>.</p><p>In this frame, the acquisition of something particularly <strong>expensive</strong> or <strong>unusual</strong> might warrant a Reaction. In these cases the World should always be forthcoming and honest about it: “<em>this will cost one whole level of Supplies, do you still want to buy it?</em>”</p><h4>Consumable Equipment</h4><p>If interesting equipment is handled individually and with Tags, and uninteresting bundles of items are abstracted into Supplies, it is also possible to join the two mechanics to achieve special effects. Thus, a few <strong>very special consumable items</strong> might be handled as unique equipment, with Tags to describe them, but also with their own specific amounts tracked as if they were a separate kind of Supplies.</p><blockquote><p>Poison Arrows [venom]: Enough</p><p>Smoke Bombs [loud][blind]: Plenty</p><p>Soul Gems [metaphysical]: Few</p></blockquote><h4>Interesting Costs</h4><p>Reducing the level of Supplies to represent the cost of expensive or unusual items is easy and fast, but not always interesting. It's ok when the World really only wants to erode the Protagonists’ resources. It's ok when no one really wants to bother with the details of a certain transaction. But in most other cases it could be better to present a cost expressed in “<strong>fictional things</strong>” to be acquired through active play and adventuring.</p><blockquote><p>\"Bring me a letter of credit from the burgomaster!\"</p><p>\"It'll cost you the jade monkey idol!\"</p><p>\"You'll owe me a favour...\"</p></blockquote><h4>Weight, Encumbrance &amp; Rising Tension</h4><p>World Reactions such as <em>Highlight a downside</em> or <em>Put them at a Disadvantage</em> can be used to work classic obstacles into the game relative to <strong>weight</strong> and <strong>encumbrance</strong>, without the need for fastidious bookkeeping.</p><p>In that sense, the very <strong>level</strong> of Supplies can be leveraged as a relevant Tag descriptor to affect fictional positioning. A Protagonist carrying <strong>Plenty</strong> of stuff might not be able to squeeze through a narrow passage, find it difficult to swim, look like a prime target for looters, or look like a baggy traveler rather than like an elegant noble.</p><p>The <em>Take away their stuff</em> Reaction can be used to enforce the <strong>passage of time</strong> through the usage of consumable resources, the depletion of ammunition, etc. Have the PCs been burning torches? Eating and drinking? Shooting arrows? These things don’t instantly reduce the level of Supplies, but their usage <strong>over time</strong> offers the World the perfect fictional positioning to enact <em>Reactions</em> that, at the right time, have the same effect.</p><p><em>Taking away their stuff</em> can also be used in an <strong>Open</strong> way (explained in <em>The World</em> chapter) to increase tension during a scene where the availability of some resource is important by stating that “<em>it is about to run out</em>”. Sure, spending a level of Supplies might be all that it takes to find out that the PC “<em>had more of it</em>” after all. But the emotional pressure of running out of something important when you need it the most is still going to be there.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":437500,"name":"The First Session","type":"text","_id":"0CQGa6xnE67EFuze","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>3.1 - Overview</h2><p>So far you’ve got an overview of <em>Fantasy World</em>’s fundamental elements; now it is time to see how it all works in practice. The first session will be mostly spent on setting your future campaign up. Here are the steps, in order, that you need to follow:</p><ol><li>Gather the needed <strong>Play Aids.</strong></li><li>Have <strong>The Talk</strong> about a few core game topics.</li><li>Do some <strong>World Building</strong> together.</li><li>Create the Protagonists’ <strong>Fellowship.</strong></li><li>Create the individual <strong>Protagonist Characters.</strong></li><li>Kick off the <strong>First Scene</strong> of the campaign.</li></ol><h3>Play Aids</h3><p>Each Player needs a copy of the <strong>Class Playbook</strong> for their Protagonist.</p><p>It is useful to have a copy of the <strong>Common Moves Sheet</strong> on hand, although one for each Player would be easier to consult during play.</p><p>The World should have a copy of the <strong>World Sheet</strong>, <strong>Agents Map</strong> and <strong>Agents Sheet</strong> at hand too, as they will often need to consult it to make choices and pick Reactions.</p><p>You only ever need <em><strong>3d6</strong></em> to play, but having more is always nice.</p><p>Finally, have some spare paper to take notes on.</p><blockquote><p>The more THEY know...</p><p>The World needs a good understanding of all the systems presented in this book, there is no way around it. But having Players that know the rules well, even better than the World, is a blessing: they can help the World get things right, catch mistakes, or explain things. Lucky is the World who can run the game while being aided by veteran Players!</p></blockquote><h3>The Talk</h3><p>Before anything else, the World has the responsibility of explaining to his fellow Players a couple of things from the <em><strong>Fundamental Knowledge</strong></em> chapter. Read the text aloud or explain it in your own words, just be sure to communicate the information correctly.</p><p><strong>Avoid</strong> talking about moves and dice for now! Instead...</p><ol><li>Explain that we are about to play a game of <em><strong>dramatic fantasy adventuring.</strong></em></li><li>Explain the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em>.</li><li><p>Explain how <em><strong>Fluid Play</strong></em> benefits from breaks<br />(and encourage Players to ask for them).</p></li><li><p>Explain what the <em><strong>Core Elements</strong></em> are<br />(Fellowship, Violence, Protagonism).</p></li><li><p>Explain what <em><strong>The Point of this Game</strong></em> is<br />(we are all playing to find out).</p></li></ol><h3>World Building</h3><p>Make a few things clear because <strong>they are true</strong> no matter what:</p><ul><li><strong>Magic is real</strong> - people know it exists from tales, folklore and direct experience.</li><li><strong>Gods are silent</strong> - are they even there? Why don’t they intervene? Only true believers know how to see the signs and recognise the omens.</li><li><strong>Cities are rare</strong> - distant points of light adrift in the vast darkness of an untamed land.</li><li><strong>Travel is perilous</strong> - communication and trade are possible but very unpredictable and taxing.</li></ul><p>Talk <strong>briefly</strong> about the setting and what to expect from it. Do you care for a game where magic and monsters are commonplace? Or are they a wondrous and terrible rarity? Do you imagine a classic Mittel-European medieval-ish society? Or would you rather explore a more unusual kind of fantasy?</p><p>While you are at it, talk about the <strong>tone</strong> you would like to go for. Dark and gritty, with hard themes and topics? Or a brighter game, with hopeful and comforting undertones? Is it ok to be ridiculous and over the top? Should we strive for a fairy tale kind of story or something on a grand epic scale?</p><p><strong>Don’t get lost</strong> in abstract discussions about the nature of things; just agree on a <strong>basic idea</strong>, a minimal starting point to be explored and discovered later through active play.</p><h3>The Fellowship</h3><p>The Fellowship is the core unit of play, the thing that establishes the Protagonists’ place in the world, their reason to stick together.</p><p>The Players will select an <strong>archetype</strong> and then answer a few questions. There is no specific sheet for the Fellowship, but they should definitely take notes to help remember the most striking details. The World will also ask more questions and note down the answers among their private notes. The exact procedure is explained in the <em><strong>Fellowship Creation</strong></em> chapter.</p><blockquote><p>During this phase don't start picking Classes blindly! Seriously, don't.</p><p>Refrain from jumping ahead into Protagonist ideas. They might not fit within the Fellowship that the group ends up creating, and then all your effort and creativity will be wasted and, even worse, tie you down to impractical ideas that you would be better off letting go of.</p></blockquote><h3>The Protagonists</h3><p>It is now time to create your individual <strong>Protagonist Characters</strong>.</p><p>First, the World has to briefly present each Class, focusing on their two unique <strong>Starting moves</strong>. You should quickly move <strong>away</strong> from abilities and powers, and instead, give time and attention to more important elements:</p><ul><li>Blood</li><li>Kin</li><li>Issue &amp; Doubt</li></ul><p>Through this whole process everyone can and should: answer questions, ask questions, take notes. Just like with the Fellowship creation, it is better to put the time and care required to have everyone come up with a satisfying character, rather than rushing things just to start play sooner. <strong>This is already play</strong>. Enjoy it now, and reap the fruits of more careful character creation later on.</p><hr /><h2>3.2 - Fellowship Creation</h2><p>You outlined a few core details about the setting and the tone of your game. Throughout this process, everyone has thrown ideas into the pot, ventured suggestions and requests, and has overall asked and answered each other’s questions. It is now time to continue this kind of creative and explorative play, but with a focus on the Fellowship that the Protagonists will be members of.</p><h3>Fellowship Play</h3><p>A <em>Fantasy World</em> campaign revolves around the concept of Fellowship: a group of Protagonist Characters that stick together to pursue a common goal. This could mean different things in play as the Fellowship is a tangible \"thing\" within the fiction, rather than an abstract concept the Players are asked to stick to.</p><p>Some Fellowship Archetypes (explained in a moment) will naturally lead play towards scenes where the PCs are seen acting together: they are in the same place, at the same time, doing stuff. But this does not mean that they have to stay together all the time. Events in the story might require them to act individually from time to time, be in different places, doing different things. This is expected and perfectly fine.</p><p>Other Fellowship Archetypes might actually set things up so that this \"individualistic\" kind of play is the norm, with only a few scenes showing the PCs all together in the same place at the same time. This might happen especially in the first few game sessions when each PC starts to establish their individual presence in the setting. This, too, is expected and perfectly fine.</p><p>The point in both cases is that the Fellowship offers strong and meaningful reasons for <strong>how</strong> and <strong>why</strong> the PCs know each other and have chosen to work together. It's a gravity well that, no matter how far an individual might go, will gently but surely keep everyone within the same orbit and general direction. It's a common touchstone, a central hub.</p><p><strong>Wandering</strong> Fellowships (<strong>Hearts</strong> and <strong>Coins</strong>) tend to focus on the <strong>group</strong> rather than the individuals. Here the World will need to use their tools to pass the spotlight from one PC to the next, preventing the contemporary occurrence of many actions from many Protagonists from obscuring and silencing the contribution of less vocal Players.</p><p><strong>Local</strong> fellowships (<strong>Shields</strong> and <strong>Knives</strong>) tend to focus on the <strong>individuals</strong> rather than the group. Here, the World will need to use their tools to manage the spotlight between parallel scenes, keeping them tight and to the point, pausing one to continue another, so that no Player is stuck being just an observer for too long.</p><p>There is no need to enforce these structures. This is just a friendly heads up to make World and Players aware that, depending on what happens in the game, their play could shift between these two tendencies.</p><h4>Breaking the Fellowship</h4><p>As flexible as a Fellowship can be, there <em><strong>is</strong></em> such a thing as the possibility to break it.</p><p>One way is when a PC <strong>parts ways</strong> to pursue their own destiny or personal agendas. This should be clear right from the start of such an endeavor: if it looks like a solo adventure that should take quite some time and/or make the PC unreachable or unavailable to the rest of the Fellowship, then they are gone, they have <strong>parted ways</strong>.</p><p>Another way is when a PC's <strong>interests don't align</strong> with those of the Fellowship and its members. Internal squabbles and conflicts are possible and even healthy, but if a PC ends up fundamentally disagreeing or disregarding the values and goals of the Fellowship or the reasons that brought the members together, then that PC has also (metaphorically) <strong>parted ways</strong>.</p><p>These things are not negative! The choices and actions leading up to such situations <strong>are a valid way to play</strong>: make your own choices and do your own thing, even if it puts you at odds with the Fellowship. It'll be a great source of dramatic tension!</p><p>But in <em>Fantasy World</em> we <strong>don't play</strong> what happens <strong>after the breakup</strong>:</p><ul><li>We <strong>don't</strong> play the divergent PC's journey.</li><li>We <strong>don't</strong> play the divergent PC's actions against the Fellowship.</li><li>The spotlight of active play will <strong>stay</strong> on the Fellowship.</li><li>The divergent PC will <strong>fade</strong> into the background, becoming an <strong>NPC</strong> under the World's control.</li><li>Their Player will create a new PC fitting the current state of the Fellowship.</li></ul><p>This is not a negative outcome, nor a loss for the Player of such a character, and indeed the divergent character <strong>could come back</strong> into active play. As an NPC, the World is strongly encouraged to treat them with the <strong>respect</strong> they would give to a Protagonist Character, even allowing their ex-Player to have <strong>a little say</strong> in how this one NPC is portrayed. Then at a later time the NPC could resume their place as their Player's <strong>active Protagonist</strong>, maybe changed, possibly grown, surely full of stories to tell their newfound old comrades.</p><h3>Fellowship Truths</h3><p>To help Players come up with Protagonists that have a better chance of working together, the Fellowship is always created <strong>before</strong> the individual PCs that form it. For this reason, at the beginning of any <em>Fantasy World</em> campaign, a few things about such Fellowship are <strong>always true</strong> no matter what other elements are in play:</p><ul><li><p>The Fellowship <strong>already exists</strong><br />All its members have been working together for weeks, months or years. The Fellowship is already formed and operating.</p></li><li><p>The Fellowship <strong>officially exists</strong><br />All members of the Fellowship know that the Fellowship exists. It is not an unspoken agreement. It is not a chance encounter. It is a thing that was <strong>explicitly discussed</strong> and agreed upon.</p></li><li><p>The Fellowship <strong>publicly exists</strong><br />People in the world are aware of the Fellowship’s existence. Maybe it’s just a rumor, maybe its members are anonymous, but nonetheless, it has a <strong>reputation</strong> in certain social circles.</p></li><li><p>The Fellowship is <strong>internally transparent</strong><br />Fellowship members know each other and have <strong>explicitly</strong> and <strong>honestly</strong> agreed to cooperate towards their common goals. Later in the game, PCs might feel differently, but at the beginning, this is the agreed-upon starting point of all Fellowships.</p></li></ul><h3>Fellowship Archetypes</h3><p>The archetype choice clearly signals what kind of adventures can be expected and offers a cohesive and solid starting point for the game. World and Players <strong>together</strong> select one archetype for the Fellowship. This is an important choice! Discuss it until <strong>everyone</strong> agrees on something that pleases and intrigues all. Cooperate to answer the questions posed by the archetype, write everything down, then talk about it, discuss it, ask further questions, offer clarifications, flesh out the Fellowship to your satisfaction.</p><p>This is already active play. Enjoy it. Take the time to do it right.</p><p>To answer the archetype questions you should imagine your PC <strong>as a person</strong>. Don’t think about Class or Blood or Kin or powers, as they make no real difference now. What kind of <strong>person</strong> do you want to play? What kind of <strong>social group</strong> (the Fellowship) does this person belong to?</p><p>Remember that the archetype is just a <strong>starting point</strong>. It tells you how things are at the beginning of the game, but it won’t prevent individual PCs from doing whatever the story might lead them to do later, transforming the Fellowship however needed.</p><hr /><h4>Shields</h4><ol><li><p><em><strong>Local</strong></em> - The Fellowship members live in <strong>a specific settlement</strong> and operate in and around it.

In this phase, everyone keeps asking and answering questions and offering ideas like before, but the World’s focus has to shift slightly. Starting here, the <strong>World’s job is to ask questions</strong> about anything they find curious or interesting about what the Players describe: That scar, how did you get it? That funny hat, why do you still wear it? Is your name a family name, or something tribal? <strong>The World does not know</strong> such things, so they ask questions. At this stage, the Players are the ones with the answers. Other Players can and should ask questions too, take an interest in each other’s PC, suggest possible answers to one another, etc. <strong>This is the real meat of the Protagonist creation process</strong>. You are already playing, describing details, telling stories, shaping your characters and the setting around them.</p><h4>Too Much of a Good Thing</h4><p>The World will continue throwing questions around and taking notes throughout the whole game, so don’t worry about asking anything about everything right now. Instead be sure to <strong>look at each other, be mindful of the table’s mood</strong>. If all participants are having a good time creating details, by all means, continue until the momentum stops on its own. Otherwise, ask each Protagonist a couple of questions, <strong>then move on</strong>.</p><p>Knowing when to stop is important, not only because some people might not enjoy the process when it drags on for too long, but also because the whole point of the game is to <em><strong>play to find out</strong></em>. Most questions would be more engaging, meaningful, and fun if answered during <strong>live play</strong> when something poignant happens in the story and you <strong>need</strong> to say something right then and there. Coming up with stuff beforehand is fine, but be careful not to overdo it.</p><hr /><h3>Protagonist Classes</h3><p>A “Class” is a bundle of unique moves meant to represent a <strong>trope</strong> or <strong>archetype</strong> commonly found in fantasy stories. In <em>Fantasy World,</em> the Classes are structured to establish <strong>how</strong> a Protagonist interacts with the world surrounding them, their range of typical <strong>skills</strong>, <strong>abilities,</strong> and <strong>common actions</strong>, rather than to define their role within a certain kind of story. This makes the Class system useful in evoking typical elements of fantasy literature while still being somewhat “<strong>neutral</strong>” in narrative terms, leaving to other elements (Blood, Kin, Issue, Doubt, etc) the job of defining the themes and roles that a Protagonist will explore during the game.</p><p>As such, Class is an important character element, because it deeply influences the “kind” of Protagonist that will be played, but at the same time, it is also <strong>the least important</strong> of all character elements, because it does not bear too much weight in who the Protagonist is going to be <strong>as a person</strong>.</p><p>Classes affect the game by shaping a bunch of elements into a certain <strong>frame</strong>, not because any one of their individual parts is absolutely unique. <strong>Mechanically</strong>, other Protagonists could grow to acquire moves from any other Class. <strong>Fictionally</strong>, the world might be full of people sporting similar items,abilities, and characteristics as the ones presented by a certain Class. The value and uniqueness of a Class resides in how <strong>the sum of its elements</strong> nudges and inspires their Player to focus on some fictional elements rather than others, putting them front and center of their <strong>personal</strong> story.</p><blockquote><p>The Veteran Class has a move that guides the Player through the creation of a special weapon, establishing that item as part of the Protagonist's story from the start of the game. Later on, during active play, the Veteran might very well meet other people that own some sort of cool weapon, maybe something that seems even more unique / weird / ancient / famous / powerful / whatever than the Veteran's one. Is this robbing the Veteran of its reason to exist? What's the point of being the Veteran if the thing defining you (the special weapon) is not so unique and special after all?</p><p>Mu! These questions are born of a fundamental misunderstanding. The point of the Veteran is not to have the most \"something\" weapon of all the game. The point of the Veteran is to have a unique relationship with their weapon. The item has personal meaning for them, it comes from somewhere, it influences their life, and therefore is an important part of that Protagonist's play experience.</p><p>\"This is my weapon. There are many like it, but this one is mine.\"</p><p>Also, the way that the rest of the Class builds upon and riffs off of this starting element is very characteristic, offering mechanical hooks and fictional prompts that conjure a different play experience from that of other Classes, setting the Veteran apart from NPCs who \"just\" have a cool weapon of their own.</p></blockquote><h4>How to Choose</h4><p><em>Fantasy World</em> offers a selection of 10 playable Classes:</p><ul><li>Captain</li><li>Knight</li><li>Maker</li><li>Occultist</li><li>Priest</li><li>Scoundrel</li><li>Troubadour</li><li>Veteran</li><li>Wayfarer</li><li>Wildcaller</li></ul><p>Every Player must pick a <strong>unique</strong> Class for their PC, meaning that no two Players can select the same Class. To decide which one is best for you, my advice is to look <strong>only</strong> at its two <strong>Starting moves</strong> and, for now, ignore the rest.</p><p>If you still have problems finding something that screams “<em>play me!</em>” at you, then consider picking a Class that you find really <strong>uninspiring</strong> or even appalling, one that you have no idea how to play, one you can’t imagine yourself enjoying... and then <strong>play that</strong>. Trust me, it works! It’s much better to play something you <strong>feel strongly about</strong>, even if it's a negative feeling, than to play something you have no opinion about. You could even play <strong>against</strong> the Class, to challenge its tropes and limits. Go for it! <strong>Play to find out</strong>. This is an adventure game, so be an adventurous Player!</p><blockquote><p>The Occultist is a fragile-bodied erudite who deals in complicated arcane stuff and doesn't know the pointy end of a sword from its butt, right?</p><p>This is the stereotype, but also nothing stops you from playing it as a brawny commoner wielding straightforward magics as a backup for their excellent fighting moves. Gandalf, hold my beer!</p></blockquote><p>And if nothing really speaks to you one way or the other, then <strong>let someone else pick</strong> a Class for you; this will avoid wasting time on analysis-paralysis, moving the game forward and making the other participants feel more invested in your PC.</p><h4>Why just one?</h4><p>This rule has <strong>nothing to do with game balance</strong>. Simply put, having multiple PCs with the same Class <strong>impoverishes the narrative experience</strong> because each Class is first and foremost an icon, a trope, a storytelling archetype offering its own outlook on adventure. Duplication of Class <strong>can be interesting</strong> to directly compare how different Players interpret the same archetype in different and unique ways, but then that campaign will bring less narrative diversity to the table.</p><blockquote><p>Same CONCEPT + Different CLASSES</p><p>Let's say that all PCs have the same concept, like being sailors crewing the same ship. They all share the same base skills and background...</p><p>...but the Veteran will be a sailor in a very different way than the Scoundrel.</p><p>...but the Occultist will shine in different moments than the Wayfarer.</p><p>...but the Knight will care about different things than the Troubadour.</p><p>...but the Priest will come up with different plans than the Wildcaller.</p><p>They are all \"sailors,\" but each brings different narrative prompts and flavors to the table.</p><p>Same CLASS + Different CONCEPTS</p><p>The PCs all pick the same Class, for example, the Wayfarer. They will still be quite different, as each Player will make different choices both at character creation and during active play. This way one PC might be a hunter, another a gladiator, another a merchant, another a noble, etc.</p><p>But for all their differences they would still bring very similar story elements to the table:</p><p>All have a special relationship with a companion animal.</p><p>All have a link with the environment.</p><p>All are well-versed in outdoorsmanship (tracking, hunting, trapping, nature lore, etc).</p><p>They are all different characters, all worth playing and exploring, but they also all touch on the same tropes, which makes for a less diverse play experience. It can be a valid and fun way to change the standard game setup, but you should be aware of its PROs and CONs.</p></blockquote><hr /><h3>Blood</h3><p>Your <strong>Blood</strong> is a kind of fictional Tag.<br />It <strong>summarizes and implies</strong> the vast galaxy of details tied to a character’s <strong>biological</strong> traits. There is no specific list of existing Bloods, so Players can decide that in their game there are only humans, or they can include classic fantasy tropes such as elves and dwarves, or they can create new unusual Bloods: lizard people, or fire people, or construct people with obsidian flesh, gold entrails and jewel bones, or sentient multi-branched telepathic cacti...</p><p>What <em>orokin blood</em> or <em>elven blood</em> or even <em>human blood</em> means in play depends on the Players playing such characters. <strong>The World defers to them for answers</strong>: which skin tones exist among dwarves? Are you taller than the average human? Is your hair type common among northern people?</p><p>Whatever their Blood is, PCs <strong>always</strong> follow these rules:</p><ul><li><strong>Human-like</strong> <strong>Shape</strong></li></ul><p>You have two legs and arms, one torso, neck, and head,all arranged in the way a human body would be.</p><ul><li><strong>Human-like Size</strong></li></ul><p>Anything from a small child to a towering adult. In any case, it fits within the general human range.</p><ul><li><strong>Human-like Needs</strong></li></ul><p>You need to drink and eat as much and as often as a human would. You need to digest, pee, cry, and sweat. You need air to breathe, light to see, time to sleep. What you can use for sustenance is also the same, or really very close, to what humans would need.</p><ul><li><strong>Human-like Abilities</strong></li></ul><p>No special powers are granted by non-human biology: no immunities, no special perceptions, no overpowering pheromones. If a common human can’t do it, then your Blood can't either.</p><ul><li><strong>Unusual Looks</strong></li></ul><p>Bloods can go crazy with unusual or even non-human skin color, hair texture, eye shape, etc. As long as it is simply a <strong>cosmetic</strong> element with no practical functionality, it is ok.</p><p>In a nutshell: all PCs are <strong>people</strong>, maybe of different Blood, but <strong>people</strong> nonetheless. Obviously, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> is critical here. If an idea is technically kosher by the above rules but feels wrong for someone at the table, it has to be fixed or go away.</p><blockquote><p>Unusual Looks</p><p>A character with Fire Blood can have hair that looks like live flames, as long as it is just normal hair with a fiery color and a naturally occurring flowing motion; it can't burn things or start a fire.</p><p>A character with Stone Blood can have skin that looks like stone, rough, and cold to the touch, as long as it is just a superficial texture; it provides no meaningful protection from harm and in many ways is not so different from normal human skin.</p><p>A character with Lizard Blood can have scale-textured skin, vertically slit pupils, a longer and more mobile tongue than that of a human, as long as the scales offer no protection, the eyes can't see in the dark and the tongue can't be used as an articulate and prehensile extra limb.</p></blockquote><h4>Stranger Bloods</h4><p><strong>If all participants agree,</strong> these rules can be slightly bent in order to accommodate specific requests. Maybe you all feel ok letting a Player create a Protagonist who is a magical pixie, as small as a butterfly, who can fly, emit light when happy or scared, and live off raw magical energy. If that is the case, more power to you! But...</p><p><strong>The proper way to do this</strong> is to make a note of all the important <strong>fictional details</strong> as the game goes on. No special rules, no numbers, just a simple description of what you can and can’t do, how you can do it, and which problems or advantages it entails. Describe, and follow the internal logic of your description. Do this <strong>a bit at a time</strong>, adding stuff as it comes up in play instead of trying to think of everything from the get-go. Again, the <em><strong>One Golden Rule</strong></em> is what makes this possible. If everyone agrees, no problem. Otherwise, fix it or remove it.</p><h4>Blood &amp; Power</h4><p>Is it a problem if a Player is granted permission to play a dragon or a stone golem while other Protagonists are good ol’ humans or other “less powerful” creatures?</p><p>No, it’s not a problem. In <em>Fantasy World</em> <strong>power balance is never an issue</strong>. Why? Because the whole point of this game is to <strong>play to find out</strong>. If <strong>all Players</strong> are interested in seeing what happens when a Protagonist has the power to destroy a city with one breath, the question is <strong>not</strong> “<em>what could balance such power</em>” but rather: what do you do after destroying the city? How do you feel about it? What consequences will such an act bring? Are adventurers and heroes coming to defeat you? Are you going to kill them too? Are you becoming a villain? What will the rest of your Fellowship do? How do the other Protagonists feel about it? Will they abandon you and break the Fellowship? Will they aid or oppose you?</p><p>The point of the game is <strong>not</strong> to challenge the Protagonists. It is <strong>not</strong> to offer a fair and balanced opposition. It is <strong>not</strong> to make good tactical choices or to overcome appropriately difficult obstacles.</p><p>These things are <strong>also</strong> part of the game but have a markedly <strong>secondary</strong> role. The most important thing, the true core of the game, is to see <strong>what happens next</strong>, to grab whatever idea is on the table and run with it to its extreme consequences until it’s interesting and entertaining for all participants involved.</p><h3>Kin</h3><p>Your <strong>Kin</strong> is a kind of fictional Tag.<br />Similar to Blood, Kin is used to <strong>summarize and imply</strong> the vast galaxy of details tied to a character’s <strong>cultural heritage</strong>. People of the same Blood can still be very different, coming from a variety of cultures,lineages, tribes, and nations. Is your PC Japanese, Norwegian, or Italian? Are they Skullander or Cloudivarian? Do they come from the Great Desert, the Salt Plains, or the Dark Swamps?</p><p>Just like Blood, Kin is created by a Player for their Protagonist, and then defined bit by bit during play whenever the World or another Player asks a question, when a move requires additional details, or when you find the opportunity and inspiration to express a small new detail.</p><p>What are the wedding rituals of your Kin? What do they consider to be art? Is there a land your kin calls home? What is the relationship between your kin and the Kathayan kin like?</p><p>Where do your people come from? Are they a common sight in these lands? Do they have a unique language? Do they worship different gods? How are their relations with other Bloods and Kins?</p><hr /><h3>Issue &amp; Doubt</h3><p>At the heart of every Protagonist there are an Issue and a Doubt. These highly personal elements serve many functions, but for now, it’s enough to know that they are the one thing steering your PCs towards Growth. To devise your own, follow these steps in this order:</p><ol><li><p>Think about your PC as a <strong>person</strong>.<br />They are living their <strong>routine</strong> life in the context of the Fellowship, their Class, their Blood and Kin, and the few bits of the world you have discussed so far. Hold onto this thought.</p></li><li><p>This person you are thinking about feels <strong>dissatisfied</strong>.<br />Right now, at this moment in their life, they want something to <strong>change</strong>, to <strong>get better</strong>, to be <strong>resolved</strong>. It could be something missing or wrong in their persona: a flaw, a lack, a fear. Or it could be something missing or wrong in the world they live in: a social issue of some kind, a bad situation, or a problematic feature of the place itself. Either way, it makes their life worse than it should, so <strong>they want it to change</strong>. They believe that if this one thing changes, it will make their life better and they will feel happy and content. This thing they want to change is the Issue.</p></li><li><p>Record and Validate your Issue.<br />Sum it up in as few words as you can in your Class Playbook, then have <strong>everyone else</strong> look over it and <strong>individually</strong> answer these questions:</p></li></ol><ul><li>Is the Issue clear and understandable?</li><li>As a spectator of this Protagonist's life, do you find their Issue interesting?</li><li>As a fellow player, do you think this Issue will be problematic to play? Is it obviously ill-fitting to the Fellowship concept?</li></ul><p>Any negative answer needs to be explained and addressed. <strong>But don’t sweat it</strong>. No Issue is ever perfect when first created. These questions are simply there to ensure that whatever you come up with falls within the \"<em>good enough to play</em>\" range of possibilities. The Issue will then be touched upon again at the end of every session, offering ample opportunities for course corrections both big and small.</p><ol><li><p>Something holds your PC back.<br />They want to address the Issue, but there is always something there to drive them away. <strong>This is never a practical external obstacle</strong>, like too many guards, too little money, too distant destinations, etc. Instead, this is always an internal block, something that saps your PC's motivation, that pulls them away from solving their Issue.</p></li></ol><p>It could be something your PC worries about: “<em>I would act on my Issue, <strong>but what if X.</strong></em>”<br />It could be something your PC wants to avoid: “<em>I would act on my Issue, <strong>but I don’t want to X.</strong></em>”<br />That “<strong>X</strong>” is your Doubt.</p><ol><li><p>Record and Validate your Doubt<br />Follow the same procedure from <em><strong>step 3.</strong></em> to note your Doubt and have everyone check if it is alright.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>Example</p><p>Person</p><p>Trax is a Green Blood from the Bad Moon clan, but now she lives in a city mostly populated by people of Galenian Blood. She and her comrades come from the Special Unit 3:16 of the city guard, where she puts her Wayfarer abilities to good use. Although her job is quite adventurous, her daily life is more or less that of a normal person, balancing work and social life in the backdrop of the big city.</p><p>Dissatisfaction</p><p>Being a Green Blood in a Galenian city, her Player decides that Trax feels alone, probably misunderstood even among her peers. This is what she wants to change.</p><p>Issue</p><p>The Player notes down \"I feel alone\" and looks at everyone else for validation. Maybe there are no problems and the procedure moves on. Maybe someone raises questions: Alone how? Are you looking for love, friendship, brotherhood, family? Is your Fellowship not enough? And why?</p><p>Some might be answered readily, some might lay open and be addressed only later in the game.</p><p>Inner Obstacle</p><p>Reflecting on why Trax would not have already solved her problem, her Player thinks that maybe she is worried about letting someone get too close to her: what if they betray me? What if I end up disappointing them? What if they reject me?</p><p>Or maybe the matter is different, like she wants to avoid the responsibilities that come from committing to a serious relationship (be it romantic or familial or brotherly).</p><p>Doubt</p><p>As a final choice, the Player writes \"They are not like me\". During validation someone asks for clarification, leading to Players and World chatting about what this Doubt means for Trax specifically. When everyone is on the same page, play continues with the next Protagonist.</p></blockquote><h4>Blank Start</h4><p>If you really have trouble with it, it is possible to postpone this whole Issue+Doubt process for a little while. Just start the game <strong>without</strong> an Issue and Doubt. This will considerably slow down your ability to <strong>Grow</strong>, but it might also allow you to make a more relaxed choice when the time is right for you. Just pause play when you feel like you have an idea for your PC’s Issue and Doubt, then follow the procedure. Beware though, as sooner is much better than later. A blank start is never ideal, but it's a valid alternative to forcing someone into making choices they are uncomfortable with.</p><p>The blank start is also a good choice when you want to get things rolling more quickly, especially when running a <strong>one-shot demo</strong> that has no real space for long-term character development. It bereaves play of its soul, but for something that starts and ends in the span of a single session, it’s not that big a deal, as there are plenty more things to showcase anyway.</p><hr /><h3>Final Details &amp; Equipment</h3><p>Now that you have worked a bit on your Class, Blood, Kin,<em><strong>and initial Issue &amp; Doubt</strong></em>, your Protagonist is almost ready for active play.</p><ul><li><p>Come up with a <em><strong>Name</strong></em>. This could be a nickname the Fellowship knows you by, or a proper name typical of your <em>Kin</em>. When in doubt, ask the others for ideas, suggestions, and inspiration.</p></li><li><p>Fill out the <strong>Look</strong> section of your Class Playbook by detailing your <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>hair,</strong> and <strong>skin</strong> without the use of “color words”. This means you are not allowed to describe, for example, your hair as simply “black” or “blond” or “red” or “green,” etc. Use <strong>similitudes</strong> instead: hair like raven feathers, eyes like sapphires, skin like milk. You are also encouraged to describe aspects other than color, like <strong>texture</strong> or <strong>style</strong> or <strong>attitude</strong>: hair tangled like a bird’s nest, eyes hard as steel, skin crossed by ropy scars.</p></li><li><p>Assign the following ratings to your four <strong>Stats</strong>: -1 +0 +1 +2</p></li><li><p>Your total of <strong>Hardiness Points</strong> are equal to <strong>1</strong>.</p></li><li><p>You are equipped with anything that could reasonably be useful to your Class, and...</p><ul><li>Surely you have a <strong>melee weapon</strong>.</li><li>You can have a <strong>ranged weapon</strong> too. Its ammunition is already part of your Supplies.</li><li>Unless you need to be free and unrestrained in your movements, you probably want <strong>some kind of armor</strong>.</li><li>Can you wield a <strong>shield alongside your weapon</strong>? If so, make a note of it.</li><li>Do you carry a musical instrument? A holy symbol? Do you have a horse or some other kind of mount? Write down any item that you deem <strong>important</strong> and somehow <strong>unique</strong>.</li><li>Do <strong>not</strong> write down generic adventurer gear such as rope, torches, metal mirror, sleeping cot, ten-foot pole, etc. This is all accounted for in your Supplies. Speaking of which, you start the game with <strong>enough</strong> Supplies.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Introduce Yourselves</h4><p>As a final step in the creation process, every Player will take a turn to briefly present their Protagonist to the other Players. Briefly go through their name and look, remind everyone of their Issue and Doubt, say in a few words what your Class can do. Listen to the others do the same. That’s it, now you are ready to go.</p><hr /><h2>3.4 - The First Scene</h2><p>Everything is ready to go. The World has a setting. The Players have a Fellowship. The Fellowship has Protagonists. The first scene of the game is kicked off depending on the kind of Fellowship you are playing.</p><h3>Wandering Fellowship</h3><p>This game begins <strong>in medias res</strong> (in the middle of things). The World will come up with a dynamic situation, throw the Protagonists into it, and spend the rest of the session rolling from there. Figuring out how and why that came to be can be interesting, but it’s of secondary importance and is better left for <strong>after</strong> the immediate situation gets resolved.</p><p>First of all the World will ask the Players to pick one option for each of the following choices:</p><ul><li><strong>Civilisation</strong> or <strong>wilderness.</strong></li><li><strong>Inside</strong> or <strong>outside.</strong></li><li><strong>Physical danger</strong> or <strong>social tension.</strong></li></ul><p>As the World you will take the choices they made, take their common Fellowship <strong>goal &amp; activities</strong>, take all the things that the World <strong>Agendas</strong> and <em><strong>Principles</strong></em> instruct you to say and do, and whip up a first scene where the Protagonists <strong>are already in some kind of trouble</strong>. Describe the situation, describe the location and the people in it, what are they doing, what they look like,and then ask the Protagonists: “<em>What do you do?</em>”</p><p>There will be a lot of questions about this unexpected situation. Answer some of them, ask questions of your own, but <strong>don’t get bogged down by details</strong> about what happened before the game started. If the Protagonists have ideas about why and how the situation came to be, let them have it their way. Or maybe they could have no idea why this is happening to them, or maybe they know but it was all a big mistake, etc.</p><p>Being the World, the specific answer doesn’t really matter much to you. If you create the situation using <em>Simple People</em> (chapter 4 section 3) you'll easily find the reasons why they do what they’re doing, and the rest will be sorted out later. Focus instead on the <strong>here and now</strong>: “<em>You are <strong>now</strong> in this situation, what do you do about it?</em>”</p><h3>Local Fellowship</h3><p>This game begins <strong>at rest</strong>. The World will explore the daily routine of the Protagonists asking each one:</p><ul><li>How do you earn your keep within the community?</li><li>What do you do on a normal day, in your spare time?</li><li>What is your favorite spot in the area?</li><li>Who do you spend most of your time with?</li></ul><p>The World will take note of what they find most interesting, looking for where the Protagonist's life might become <strong>unstable</strong>. Once all Protagonists have offered their answers, the World will frame a scene using the material the Players provided.</p><p><strong>Do not try to start with a bang</strong>. It's unnecessary. Just put the Protagonists in a normal/routine situation and introduce some kind of problem that <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/fantasyworldrpg/the-world#h.p_g4qX9Ag0beJA\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/fantasyworldrpg/the-world#h.p_g4qX9Ag0beJA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>makes sense</em></a> in context. Play will flow from here, and things will soon get complicated and interesting on their own.</p><p>This scene could feature all the Protagonists, but that's not mandatory. The World has <em>carte blanche</em> here, and it could also be a good idea to look at the list of <a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/fantasyworldrpg/the-world#h.p_QAHGpc7XTL3b\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/fantasyworldrpg/the-world#h.p_QAHGpc7XTL3b\" target=\"_blank\"><em>World Reactions</em></a> to find inspiration on how to set up an \"interesting\" situation.</p><p>Be sure to portray <em>Simple People</em> (chapter 4 section 3) each with some kind of need, problem, desire, dream, fear, worry, or prejudice. Have them act and interact with the Protagonists and among themselves. Keep in mind the Fellowship's characteristics, its <strong>Goals and Activities</strong>, and how they could relate to the local population.</p><h3>Kickoff</h3><p>Be it a Wandering or Local start, from here on everyone will just follow the game conversation. As the Players follow the procedures explained in the rules, their Protagonists will spontaneously act and react to the situation, explore the setting around them, and progress towards the potential objectives and tensions set up by their individual Issues and Doubts. Likewise, the World will also act and react, presenting new situations, characters, places, and showing the consequences of the Protagonists’ choices.</p><p>Everyone should look out for descriptions that can trigger a move. Any tense conversation could be ripe for <em><strong>Reading a Person,</strong></em> <em><strong>Looking Around,</strong></em> or both. Start getting used to noticing these things.</p><p>While this happens the World is also <strong>scribbling notes like crazy</strong>. Every NPC encountered, give it a name and a simple goal and motivation. Every location visited, add it to a map and jot down one to three adjectives to describe it. And start working on the Agents Map, which will lay the foundation of future events.</p><p>When it is time to wrap up the game, remember to perform the <em><strong>End of Session</strong></em> move.</p><p>Finally, <strong>between the first and second sessions</strong>, while you do your World prep, remember to also create all the <strong>Essential Agents</strong> (chapter 4 section 5) needed to fuel the campaign.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Game Moves","type":"text","_id":"qg2XUgJkQc0sBhDA","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>5.1 - Common Moves</h2><p>If a PC does something that looks like a move, it is the move.

On a 7-9 the PC retains much less control: they have been pushed to do harm, but still force the victim to react in a limited way.</p><p>In both cases, the PC might get what they want, plain and simple.

The World can frame it either <strong>near the end</strong> of the journey, sometime <strong>after</strong> all the short events seen so far, or already at the destination, especially if the location is not new or arrival is not urgent. <strong>Otherwise</strong>, you have arrived.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>The Fellowship undertakes a journey through a desert area.

This time it's the Occultist's turn to perform steps 1 through 4.</p><p>5) Once every PC has played one of these short scenes, a Long Rest is performed to give them a chance to regroup, prepare and maybe have something unexpected happen, just before reaching their intended destination.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Long Rest</p><p>When you spend <strong>a few hours</strong> taking shelter and resting &gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>When the World skips over <strong>a few days</strong> of time…</p><p>If the World or a Player wants to explore such downtime, then <strong>all PCs involved</strong> in it perform step 1).</p><p>1) Each PC in turn <strong>must</strong> play a <em>Utility</em> scene.<br />Describe <strong>where</strong> and <strong>when</strong> it happens within the downtime, then pick <strong>one</strong> effect from the list and describe <strong>what you do</strong> to achieve it:</p><ul><li><strong>spend Supplies</strong> to apply one <strong>HU</strong> to one harm effect</li><li><strong>spend Supplies</strong> to regenerate one <strong>HP</strong></li><li>add +1 <em>WATCH</em> to the group total (max +3)</li><li>do <strong>one</strong> useful thing: build, repair, or prepare something</li></ul><p>After a full round of <em>Utility</em> scenes, individual PCs can <strong>spend 1 XP</strong> to join a new round.

At the moment it reads \"Am I worthy of my station?\"...</p><p>She doesn't feel the need to reword it.</p><p>All things considered, she feels like Solinas has kind of mastered it, so Claudia marks 3 Growths and skips ahead to step 3.</p><p>Claudia considers Solinas' actions in this session and...</p><p>She mentions the goofy moment between Solinas and the talking moth. Everyone agrees that it was hilarious, thus quite memorable. Maysa mentions the \"slap scene\" as her favorite of the session, and Julian comments that he liked the quiet moment of \"the big decision\" best. With so many memorable moments happening to Solinas, Claudia definitely earns her 1 XP.</p><p>Solinas was involved in a bunch of Bonding Scenes this time around, so she gets 1 XP for this too.</p><p>Through play, Claudia mentioned many details about Solinas' Blood and Kin, but none of them were new, so she gets no XP for this.</p><p>After accruing marks and points it's time to spend them...</p><p>Claudia had 9 out of 10 XPs before the End of Session move began and now has ended up with a total of 11 out of 10. During active play, the one point beyond the maximum would be lost, but during this move, she first has the option to spend some XPs, and she does just that but opts to only spend 5 in exchange for 1 Growth mark. This way she'll begin the next session with a comfortable pool of 6 XP in case she needs them during active play to get Advantage or fuel some Class move.</p><p>For some reason Claudia had not been spending her Growth marks and now has a total of 12 available, which look something like this [＊＊X X X]. She would like to spend 10 in order to unlock 2 Growth Options, but she can't because there is a hard limit of 1 Growth Option per session. She will have to spend only 5 now, with 7 leftovers that look like this [X X / / /].</p><p>Next session she'll be able to spend 5 more and, if she earns no new Growth marks, there will be only 2 leftovers [/ / O O O].</p><p>In this session Claudia has mastered Solinas' Doubt, so she transcribes it somewhere for safekeeping, then erases it from the Doubt section of her Class Playbook, and starts mulling over a new Doubt for Solinas.</p><p>Right on the spot, she has no clear ideas, so she leaves the task to be done sometime before next week's game session. This way she'll have time to check the rulebook and chat about it with her fellow Players.</p><p>Now that Claudia has performed the move in its entirety, she names Maysa to go next through the steps.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Epilogue</p><p>When <strong>you die</strong> or are just about to…</p><p>Pick up to 3 <em>OPTIONS</em> from the following list, each only once:</p><ol><li>Lose one of your unlocked <strong>Growth</strong> Options.</li><li><strong>Shift 1 Stat</strong> point to a different Stat (min. -1, max. +3).</li><li><p>Acquire a <em><strong>Tag</strong></em> from this list and describe what it means specifically for your PC:</p><ul><li>[<em><strong>disgraceful appearance</strong></em>]</li><li>[<em><strong>impeded mobility</strong></em>]</li><li>[<em><strong>unsteady hands</strong></em>]</li><li>[<em><strong>impaired senses</strong></em>]</li><li>[<em><strong>weakened health</strong></em>]</li></ul></li></ol><p>Now roll+<em>OPTIONS</em>:</p><ul><li><p>10+: You live on, but Death has <strong>changed</strong> you.<br /><em>Renew</em> your current Issue, Doubt, or both.</p></li><li><p>7-9: You live on, but Death has <strong>taken something</strong> from you.<br />Create a Tag expressing what you have <strong>lost</strong>: hope, innocence, fear, joy, rage, purpose, confidence, identity, a cherished memory, etc. Then <em>Renew</em> as with 10+.</p></li><li><p>1-6: Alas, you died.<br />After the scene ends, but before the <em>End of Session</em> move is performed, you get to unlock a <strong>Closure</strong> option.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Notes on Epilogue</strong></p><p>No one can Intervene.</p><p>Dis/Advantages do not apply.</p><p>Lost Growth options can be unlocked again by spending 5 Growth marks, as usual.</p><p>For instructions on how to Renew your Issue and Doubt, see the notes for the End of Session move.</p><p>Closure options are the four special Growth options that become available after your 5th Growth.

First, an important caveat.</p><h3>Homebrewing vs Improvising</h3><p>What we are talking about here is <strong>homebrew game design</strong>, something you prepare beforehand and introduce to the game if everyone agrees:</p><ul><li>Known rules should <strong>not</strong> change mid-session or surreptitiously.</li><li>New rules should <strong>not</strong> be winged on the fly and sprung upon unsuspecting Players.</li><li>Fudging rules and rolls <strong>will</strong> create problems. Other games might require some <em>rule improvisation</em> to function properly, but not this game. Be wary of old habits and keep them in check.</li></ul><p><em>Fantasy World</em> works because World and Players <strong>trust each other</strong>. In this relationship, the rules as written are the <strong>explicit foundation</strong> upon which we all stand, providing a frame to keep things honest and to build mutual trust. But trusting the rules and each other doesn’t have to mean zeal and rigidity! When some specific mechanic feels puzzling and it’s unclear how to proceed, the group can and should agree on a <strong>quick ruling</strong> to get them to the end of the session. There will be time later to do proper research, learn how the game works, and play better next time. The group can and should <strong>discuss and critique</strong> the game to check if they are experiencing any problems to understand if they stem from the rules, and to figure out how to address them.<br />The point is: relax. Trust the rules and trust each other - playing <strong>is not a performance</strong>: you are all <strong>learning</strong> together, you are all <strong>responsible</strong> for each other’s enjoyment, and there is no need to keep the engine running while you hot-fix it mid-race. And then, in between sessions, with time and a cool head, agree on how to play this game the way you like the most.</p><h3>Technique #1 - Know Thy Game</h3><p>The first rule for good homebrew design is: <strong>know the game</strong>. Try it out vanilla, give yourself time to get acquainted with its rules, to grok them, and use them as intended. <strong>This might require a few sessions</strong>, some trial and error, and definitely a bunch of goodwill from both World and Players as they get past the initial learning curve. But the rewards are bountiful:</p><ul><li>You might discover a game experience you were not expecting. This broadens and enriches your designer’s toolbox. <strong>Intimately knowing</strong> many different games is exceedingly useful.</li><li>It makes taking the game apart and working on it much easier, faster, safer, and more effective. Time spent understanding is time saved, many times over, when designing.</li></ul><p>This might sound obvious, but part of the current RPG culture actually holds the idea that all games are kind of the same, that rules don’t make much of a difference, and that “expert” roleplayers can and should modify a game before having run it even once. <strong>I disagree</strong>.</p><hr /><h3>Technique #2 - Fictional Reskin</h3><p>Most will get a <strong>lot</strong> of mileage out of this technique, as it is the easiest and safest to put into practice, and it’s great for what people need the most: <strong>adding new stuff</strong> to the game, be it a Move, a Class, a special rule or even a whole new Setting.</p><p>Many <em>Fantasy World</em> mechanics are just “frames” that grant specific shape and function to narrative elements, leveraging their inherent fictional positioning. Thus, by simply changing the fictional elements of a rule, you can craft completely new content without actually having to design new rules. Change the skin not the bones, so to speak.</p><h4>Move Reskin</h4><p>As mentioned in chapter 2.1, a move always has two elements: a <strong>fictional trigger</strong> and a linked <strong>effect</strong>. These both present a good amount of fictional elements.</p><ul><li><p>The Knight’s move <em><strong>I Am the Law</strong></em> activates <em>“when you act as arbiter in a dispute”</em>, positioning the Protagonist as an agent of order and mediation within someone else’s conflict, bringing forth the theme of institutions meddling in people’s lives through the rule of law.<br />If the move instead activated <em>“when you make an example of someone”</em> it would make the PC into an agent of punishment, retribution, or maybe of brutal rule, more akin to a warlord or an inquisitor than a Knight, evoking themes of personal power, its exertion over others, and its possible abuse.</p></li><li><p>The common move <em><strong>Journey</strong></em> leads Players to vividly explore and enrich the territory they travel through.</p><ul><li>Do you want a new move to do the same in urban areas? Just copy <em><strong>Journey</strong></em> but call it <em><strong>City Traversal</strong></em> and instead of triggering “<em>when undertaking a long journey</em>” it activates <em>“when traversing a big urban area”</em>. The rest of the move text will take on a new meaning without the need to rewrite it.</li><li>Do you want to ramp up the social gameplay? Same move, different skin: the <em><strong>Mingling</strong></em> move triggers <em>“when navigating a big social gathering”</em>. The destination is always the end of the event, but how you get there becomes the focus. In place of maps and routes you need to know the social landscape of the event, who’s who, their relationships. New people or unexpected circumstances might make your directions vague. Navigating an event out of your social circles might mean you don’t know the way. Each step of the move would then represent a meeting, a diversion, a potential misstep or opportunity. The consequences of rolling a <strong>Snag</strong> need a bit more reworking and abstract thinking, but not much: lost Supplies represent well the idea of your PC having to produce coin and trinkets in order to maintain a certain image of themselves, while <strong>Harm</strong> can easily enough be conceptualized as social or emotional (while still being marked in the standard way, otherwise we would be modifying more than just the skin of the move).</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Class Reskin</h4><p>A Class is nothing more than a high-concept idea holding together a <strong>bundle of moves</strong>. These are crafted to translate that concept and its related themes into active play. Since most moves rely heavily on descriptive elements, these are often designed to be read in personal or abstract ways, allowing moves to be relevant in different contexts and to adapt to different Protagonists and play styles. This means that an entire Class can be forged into something more specific, unique, and different just by reading it through a <strong>different lens</strong>. Sure, not all Class moves will transition perfectly right out of the box, but the <strong>core elements</strong> will be usable immediately, leaving the rest to be figured out later on, if the need ever arises at all.</p><p>Not only do you not need to develop a new Class to introduce a new Protagonist type into play, but you can also approach the same Protagonist idea from different angles by using different Classes as the base of adaptation.</p><ul><li><p>The Captain owns a nexus, leads a crew, and is all about the dealings carried out with the former and the relationships entertained with the latter...</p><ul><li><strong>The Innkeeper</strong> manages a tavern and its employees against the backdrop of a fantasy town and its strange inhabitants.</li><li><strong>The Aristocrat</strong> handles a whole noble estate, its staff, and the other members of the bloodline under the PC’s care and authority.</li><li><strong>The Explorer</strong> could lean on the nomadic elements of the Captain to become the linchpin of a whole campaign focusing on geographical discovery, with potentially tragic and even horrific undertones depending on how hostile and unknown the landscape is.</li></ul></li><li><p>The Veteran is about showing prowess, the consequences of living dangerously, and carrying around a uniquely meaningful tool. These elements can easily be adapted to very different purposes...</p><ul><li><strong>The Old Adventurer</strong> proudly bears the marks, scars, and tattoos from past voyages, showing prowess through crusty wisdom and tall tales.</li><li><strong>The Navigator</strong> reskins the meaningful tool from weapon to vehicle, allowing the PC to show prowess through skillful maneuvering and marked leadership, working as a more individualistic and action-oriented version of the Captain.</li><li><strong>The Spectacle</strong> could use some sort of art implement as their tool, showing prowess through captivating performance and carrying the signs of a debaucherous life - a less magical but more jaded version of the Troubadour.</li></ul></li><li><p>Want to play a <strong>Necromancer</strong>? Just reskin the Wildcaller by substituting references to “nature” with elements such as ghosts, the dead, and gothic/cemeterial symbols.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Call to the Beast</strong></em> turns you into death-themed or gothic-themed animals such as crows and ravens, vultures, wolves, rats, plague vermins, etc.</li><li><em><strong>Call to the Grove</strong></em> animates corpses instead of plants, and requires the proximity of a cemetery instead of lush vegetation.</li><li>The rest follows from here with both obvious transitions and open questions. You communicate with the spirits of the dead, instead of those of nature. But do dead animals leave a ghost behind? Are there other death-related entities besides ghosts and specters? What do the deceased remember of their past life?</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Mechanical Reskin</h4><p>One way to reskin a mechanic is to take a rule and apply it to a context it was not originally meant for.</p><ul><li><strong>Fictional Harm</strong> rules are a perfect example. Originally they handle how characters suffer physical damage and how this translates into tangible descriptive consequences. The game already reskins them to model physical conflict between <strong>groups</strong> simply by rewriting the descriptions in the list of harm effects. The same could be done again to add more depth and detail to how <strong>vehicles</strong> or <strong>buildings</strong> take harm. Previously I suggested a way to represent “social damage“ simply by reading physical effects as a metaphor for social and emotional ones, but you could just as well craft an independent list of harm effects unique to <strong>social conflicts</strong>.</li><li>Another reskin might see <strong>Expedience Points</strong> take on a different meaning. Call them <em>Rage Points</em> or <em>Justice Points</em> or <em>Karmic Balance Points</em> and you will significantly alter their impact on the game’s narrative, although their function is the same.</li><li>The very structure of the Fellowship is itself a mechanic that can easily be reskinned. Just use the standard elements common to all Fellowship Archetypes, and fill them with different names, descriptions, and questions.</li></ul><p>Though not technically a reskin, the use of Tags to alter the fictional positioning of something can achieve most of what “new rules” would. The catch is that the impact of these new pseudo-rules will depend on Players and World giving them care and attention.</p><ul><li><p>Being a <em><strong>[surgeon]</strong></em> surely allows a PC to <em><strong>Recall Lore</strong></em> on specialized topics. It might allow the PC to save someone’s life, maybe through free play and sheer fictional positioning, maybe by <em><strong>Taking a Risk</strong></em>. And in general, the World will perform different Reactions when responding to the PC’s actions and choices:</p><ul><li>Where another Protagonist would just have an NPC die in their arms or suffer further damage, the <em><strong>[surgeon]</strong></em> might just face a difficult choice or get some bad news.</li><li>Where another Protagonist versed in “adventurer’s first-aid” might be <strong>denied</strong> the possibility to help a gravely wounded patient, even preventing them from picking some options during a <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em>, the <em><strong>[surgeon]</strong></em> will be allowed those options.</li><li>Being a <em><strong>[surgeon]</strong></em> might carry some drawbacks, such as being seen as a charlatan, a butcher, or someone suspicious because they challenge the culture of a superstitious group.</li></ul></li><li>The existence of <em><strong>[star metal]</strong></em> can introduce all sorts of new “mechanics”. <em><strong>[Star metal]</strong></em> blades might cut through anything. <em><strong>[Star metal]</strong></em> armor might be very light or naturally blend with ambient shadows, or, conversely, it might amplify reflected light. <em><strong>[Star metal]</strong></em> tools might be more precise or allow for normally impossible tasks. Is it rare, carrying great value, or common, radically altering the look of your setting? Can it be made into a combustible or fuel? Can it be ingested to grant abilities? Would that poison you, get you addicted, cause hallucinations?</li></ul><p>The same effects can be achieved through the definition and exploration of Bloods and Kins, as they are themselves just specialized kinds of Tags.</p><h4>Setting Reskin</h4><p>Each of the previous techniques is a way to express the unique qualities of an original setting through active game mechanics rather than through pages and pages of descriptions: a sort of <em>Play, don’t say</em> principle. By putting all of these methods together, one can define a whole game setting, be it an original creation or an attempt at capturing the aesthetics and some core elements of a favorite movie, novel, comic, etc.</p><p>The series of <strong>quick settings</strong> presented in the <em>Kosmohedron</em> sourcebook, as well as those freely available online (such as <strong>SILIKA</strong>), are perfect examples: some are drier and to the point, while others lean on a more traditional and verbose approach, but all follow a common underlying structure.</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Core Concept</strong></em><br />This is where “fluff” goes, be it a short introduction to the setting and its core elements, a summary of its relevant history, or an explanation of the angle the group will explore, etc. Guidelines, comments, and suggestions about style, tone, and reference materials should go here. That said, the four fundamental <em><strong>Fantasy World Truths</strong></em> (about magic, gods, cities, and travel) should always stand, although they too can be reskinned to better fit the new setting.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Example Fellowship Archetypes</strong></em><br />New or reskinned Fellowship Archetypes can be presented, being as generic (guards) or as specific (the Tooth Fairy guards of EverBrush) as the setting needs. Again, the universal <strong>Fellowship Truths</strong> should stand, as well as the core Archetype elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Range</strong>: whether the Fellowship is Local or Wandering.</li><li><strong>Goals &amp; Activities</strong>: the main point of the Fellowship and some example activities it may engage in.</li><li><strong>Starting Concepts</strong>: three possible interpretations of the Archetype.</li><li><strong>Scope</strong>: the possible “levels” of people and dealings the Fellowship is usually involved with.</li><li><strong>Reputation</strong>: a few non-neutral options.</li><li><strong>Roots</strong>: a few questions meant to root each member of the Fellowship into the setting by linking them to places, people, goals, problems, etc.</li></ul></li><li><p><em><strong>Example Bloods &amp; Kins</strong></em><br />Maybe there are a few Bloods that are unique to your setting. It is advisable to keep them within the standard humanoid frame, but <strong>Stranger Bloods</strong> can be defined too. Like most other elements in <em>Fantasy World,</em> the aim here is mainly to offer stimulating and evocative ideas that Players will later explore on their own. The same goes for example Kins.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Example Issues &amp; Doubts</strong></em><br />While these elements are meant to be strictly personal to each Protagonist, with the Doubt being created as a consequence of the Issue, it is possible to offer a few examples that engage with the unique themes of a specific setting.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Example Classes</strong></em><br />For each existing Class there could be a short list of example reskins. Or perhaps a few tips and guidelines on how to translate a strong idea or unique character archetype from your chosen source material into the mechanics of one (or more) existing Classes.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Example Stuff</strong></em><br />The final section of any setting should offer a selection of <strong>short lists of stuff</strong> meant for both World and Players to use as inspirational material and ready-to-play options. Each entry can be as simple as a name linked to a short but vivid description, to evoke flavor and spark ideas. A few important categories are:</p><ul><li><strong>Objects</strong>: this is less of a shopping list, more of a trove of evocative “things” that somehow express the unique feel and identity of the setting, from a simple <em>pouch of sea shells</em> to the very specific and famous <em>Queen Demetra’s oyster of the Ages</em>.</li><li><strong>Locations</strong>: Same as above, but for places. A cabin in the woods, the river Karaf, the gem-cutter neighbor in the city of Dursh...</li><li><strong>People</strong>: Same as above, but for individuals, groups, organizations, etc. The church of the <em>Hanging Koala</em>, a roving vagrant with deep blue eyes, <em>Tosk</em> the eternal fugitive...</li><li><strong>Creatures</strong>: Same as above, but for animals and other non-humanoid entities. A bale of flying turtles, the flaming <em>Koh</em> fishes of the northern waters, the Beast of <em>Magdalenburg</em>...</li></ul></li></ul><hr /><h3>Technique #3 - Rules Remix</h3><p>The “remix” of mechanical elements is about <strong>moving</strong> existing rules <strong>around</strong>, <strong>removing</strong> some altogether, or <strong>cloning</strong> them to serve additional purposes.</p><p>A simple application is the modification of existing Classes. Each Class has exactly 2 Core moves and 9 Growth ones. It’s enough to <strong>swap</strong> one of the Core moves with one of the Growth ones to create a variant of the original Class that, from the very beginning, sets a different tone and direction for the Protagonist. A Scoundrel might become a poisoner, a dirty fighter, or a spy right from the start, instead of growing into such specializations.</p><p>Another form of remix is the <strong>removal</strong> of options. Maybe a Fellowship archetype is not available in your version of the game. Maybe some Classes are banned from active play. Maybe some specific Moves are. A Wayfarer without the <em><strong>Animal Companion</strong></em> move (and other linked moves) would play as a very different kind of character, more like a scout or a hunter.</p><p>Finally, <strong>cloning</strong> is a form of remix too. Use any of the previously-mentioned techniques to add to, instead of change, a part of your game. Create different reskins of a Class, then let them all be part of active play. Clone the harm system to present a separate list of harm effects specific for social status and reputation, one for emotional health, and one for arcane/spiritual wellness. Complement it all with the appropriate clone of Hardiness Points.</p><hr /><h3>Technique #4 - Designing Moves</h3><p>Crafting new moves is probably the most common activity that most PbtA players can imagine entertaining. Here I’ll try to express some of the principles and best practices at the root of <em>Fantasy World</em> ones.</p><h4>Improvised Moves</h4><p>Some games advocate creating moves on the fly as a spur of the moment “fix” or to “spice things up” with a dice roll. This might be all well and good in those games, but <em>Fantasy World</em> follows and advocates a different approach.</p><p>If a move is so simple/obvious that you could whip it up on the fly, then it’s most likely that <strong>you don’t need it</strong> in the first place. <em>Fantasy World</em> mechanics lean heavily on raw fiction as an active and relevant part of the game. Use those. <strong>Don’t improvise moves</strong>. Especially when the main goal is to inject uncertainty – What will the NPC do? Will the PC succeed? Will an event occur? You are just producing a glorified coin flip with extra bits attached. In part, this is too much work for too little return value. In part it is <strong>bad form</strong> that damages the foundation of the Players-Moves-World tension:</p><ul><li>Players can count on <strong>moves</strong> to know how something works, with the World being the judge of how <strong>everything else</strong> works.</li><li>Meanwhile, moves impose specific conditions that deeply affect Player behavior and choices.</li><li>Hence the tension: keep control by relying on a move and its conditions, or do as you please while relinquishing control to the World.</li></ul><p>Improvising moves for the sake of “plugging holes” in the game goes directly against this fundamental principle. If the goal is to shake things up, both World and Players have plenty of effective tools at their disposal within the standard confines of <em>Fantasy World</em> mechanics. You <strong>don’t need</strong> to improvise moves left and right.</p><p>Instead, you should design new moves <strong>away</strong> from active game time, carefully thinking them through to serve whatever purpose World and Players might have. This is homebrew design. This, I wholeheartedly support.</p><h4>Why Moves?</h4><p>Moves can serve many purposes, but in general, what they do is <strong>draw attention</strong> to a specific bit of narrative. If you have a move to handle something, that something becomes a <strong>known quantity</strong> even if the move itself offers inherently dangerous and costly outcomes; defining something makes it relatively reliable and, by extension, it will end up happening more often.</p><p>This is also why <em>Fantasy World</em> tries to keep the total number of moves in check. Because the more moves you have in play, the less they are effective in drawing attention, and the less they get used and become relevant in the game. Always beware of <strong>moves creep</strong>.</p><p>Because of the attention they draw to themselves, moves tend to become <strong>the way</strong> to do the thing they describe, something that Players plan for and count on, affecting how they imagine the game’s narrative. Case in point, the standard rules clearly allow for non-move ways to perform almost anything in the game, but because these methods are <strong>uncertain</strong> and require <strong>negotiation</strong> amongst Players and World, they tend to be forgotten. Therefore, the presence or absence of a move can deeply impact your game.</p><blockquote><p>For example, Fantasy World determines, as a fundamental truth, that magic exists and that its existence is not a secret. But there is no Common Move for magic. Why?</p><p>Because this way magic becomes less of a tool in the eyes of Players and World. Any character with the proper fictional positioning can perform magic, but the lack of a ready-made move makes this occurrence less common.</p><p>And then when magic does occur, its lack of clear-cut rules helps preserve its aura of mystery and wonder.-something open-ended that can be explored through active play, but never fully trusted.</p><p>Also, when a Class move defines how magic works, this statement has value only within the context of that specific Class. This means many things:</p><p>Bringing a Class into play is a core Player choice, something we know is interesting to them and needs to be explored as a focal point of our adventures. This implies that it's ok to devote more mental/mechanical space to the topic.</p><p>In light of the previous point, we know that magic is something we will touch on often, so it's actually expedient and desirable to have some ground rules for it, something the Player can partly rely upon.</p><p>Finally, one class' magic is not all magic. While defining how this one character handles it, magic at large can still be explored and detailed without necessarily dictating how anyone else's magic ought to work.</p><p>These points are representative of the specific choices that went into this one element of Fantasy World, in the context of the overall game vision. Maybe your vision is different, and you'll arrange things in another way. But it's a good example of how moves (or lack thereof) can affect the final game experience, and of how they should be seen as tools to achieve a cohesive vision rather than as throw-away toys to be carelessly improvised.</p></blockquote><p>A secondary value of moves is their <strong>expediency</strong>. A single move can abstract away game elements that Players and World find, when freely roleplayed, to be tedious, uninteresting, or even problematic. This is particularly valuable if, for some reason, those elements somehow tend to present themselves often in your narratives. A well-placed move can save <strong>hours</strong> of gameplay from being wasted on something the group doesn’t really enjoy.</p><blockquote><p>Some groups love roleplaying scenes where their Protagonists hatch a plan of action, go over details, evaluate possibilities, and debate potential strategies. Some groups don't. This might warrant the introduction of a new move to address the issue.</p><p>Here are two examples of how to tackle the same problem through different approaches: first a move that models the whole process of hatching a plan and helps jump right into the action, greatly inspired by how the game Knives by John Harper structures its \"engagement\" phase; the second is a move that instead helps Players do the actual planning themselves, while also offering a tool that fixes one of the main problems this activity presents.</p><p>Make a Plan #1</p><p>When you work with others to hatch a plan of action…</p><p>Have all involved characters agree on the following points:</p><p>What is the end goal of the plan?</p><p>Who will be part of it?</p><p>Will the approach be direct or indirect?</p><p>Will you act in an overt or covert way?</p><p>The characters can now answer these three questions as a group:</p><p>Can you exploit an inherent weakness of the target?</p><p>Can you leverage to your advantage an external event, situation, or third party?</p><p>Can your allies provide substantial help or intel?</p><p>Get +1 SCHEME for each YES. In order to answer positively, at least one PC must briefly describe how they intend to go about it based on established fiction. You can't just make things up on the spot. Instead, you can interrupt this move at this stage to go establish the needed fiction, either through direct action or by hatching a dedicated plan.</p><p>Once the SCHEME rating is final, the World will frame the involved characters in a situation where they are facing the first obstacle of the mission, but first, they roll+SCHEME:</p><p>10+ = The situation is under control.</p><p>7-9 = The situation is ok but... + Open Reaction.</p><p>1-6 = The situation was ok until... + Closed Reaction.</p><p>Make a Plan #2</p><p>When you work with others to hatch a plan of action…</p><p>Instead of debating what to do, have each PC briefly express their idea for a section of the plan.</p><p>If everyone agrees, that section is noted down and the PCs move on to outline the next section.</p><p>Otherwise, each PC can spend a mix of XPs, HPs, and Supplies to \"vote\" for their own or someone else's idea for the current section.</p><p>Each resource has a value of 1 vote.</p><p>PCs must exceed, not match, others' votes.</p><p>Resources are not bid, but immediately spent, no matter who wins the vote.</p><p>All resources spent in voting are recorded as SCHEME points in a common pool. These are XP that anyone acting to accomplish part of the plan can access to buy Advantage or to fuel Moves, but not to obtain Growth marks.</p><p>During this process, the World should warn and advise the Players in case of unrealistic expectations, overly-simplistic plans, or grossly obvious missing pieces.</p><p>Both World and Players should take note of each section of the plan as they get agreed upon or voted on.</p><p>Once the plan is shaped to the satisfaction of all involved PCs, the planning phase ends. The World will then go through all the plan's sections one by one, doing one of two possible things:</p><p>Acknowledge the success of the section, describe it, or ask Players to do it themselves.</p><p>Frame a situation in which the PCs face some problem that emerged during the section.</p></blockquote><h4>Move Triggers</h4><p>The highest value of a good trigger is its <strong>unambiguous clarity</strong>. The easier it is to tell if a move has been triggered, the better the move is. This means facing a difficult balancing act between using more words to offer exhaustive information and avoid misunderstandings and using fewer words to craft a more terse and concise message. In this, aesthetic considerations come <strong>last</strong>, if ever at all: a good trigger doesn't need to be cool, evocative, or suggestive. That’s what the move's <strong>name</strong> is for.</p><p>The most common kind of trigger is the one that outlines a <strong>character action</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>When you observe something…</p></blockquote><p>Moves are mandatory, engaging the mechanics <strong>every single time</strong> that the trigger is described. In general, the more clear, concise, and unambiguous the trigger is, the better the move will be: easier to remember, to spot in actual play, to use correctly, etc.</p><p>By adding a <strong>modal</strong> element to the trigger, the whole move becomes more specific and less frequent, allowing the Player to describe their Protagonist’s actions in such a way as to occasionally sidestep the trigger.</p><blockquote><p>When you observe something for a long time…</p><p>When you observe something from a great distance…</p><p>When you observe something through the eyes of your heart…</p></blockquote><p>This will often hinder, albeit slightly, the clarity and effectiveness of the trigger, but the added flexibility might be worth the price. An alternative method is to set the modal element as a <strong>conditional</strong> part of the effect, thus keeping the trigger free of clutter while still granting the Player some latitude. Of course, the cost of added complexity is merely shifted somewhere else, not really avoided, but the trade-off might better suit some situations.</p><blockquote><p>When you observe something…</p><p>If you do it for a long time...</p><p>If you do it from a great distance...</p><p>If you do it through the eyes of your heart...</p></blockquote><p><br />Another common type of trigger defines not an action, but a <strong>state of things</strong>. This might look like a specific set of external circumstances, or as a direct statement of fact.</p><blockquote><p>When you are hungry…</p><p>When it rains…</p><p>When people look to you for guidance…</p><p>or...</p><p>You are a valiant knight…</p><p>You know the secrets of cheese-making…</p><p>The sun is your ally…</p></blockquote><p>These moves are inherently more <strong>passive</strong>, and therefore less engaging. Again, it might be an acceptable price to pay if it helps you design the game effect you have in mind, but it’s usually best to keep them to a minimum.</p><h4>Move Effects</h4><p>The best way to conceptualize the effect of a move is to ask the question: <strong>how do I want the fiction to change?</strong> Sometimes, this is already satisfied by the trigger. Especially with triggers focused on PC actions, a Player might have already described something that would impact the fiction meaningfully. Job done. But other times the trigger was really just a necessary set-up for the desired narrative to come, in which case something else needs to happen during the resolution of the move effect.</p><p>When the fiction is already where the designer wants it to be, the effect can be simpler: be it a mechanical effect or a narrative outcome, it just needs to <strong>represent</strong> or <strong>reinforce</strong> what has already been described through the trigger. Of course, nothing prevents these moves from also injecting <strong>further</strong> change and consequences.</p><blockquote><p>When you hug someone…</p><p>…you feel better.</p><p>…you feel better. Get an Advantage.</p><p>…they pick one: feel weirded out and give you 1 XP, or reciprocate the hug and get 1 XP.</p><p>…they will understand how you feel, beyond any communication barrier.</p><p>Roll+INTENSE. The embrace:</p><p>10+ = it's nice and they take it well.</p><p>7-9 = it's awkward and they will communicate that.</p><p>1-6 = it's wrong and they will react accordingly.</p></blockquote><p>When the trigger is only a setup for change, the effect is what needs to bring about the desired narrative change. This can happen in a few common ways:</p><ul><li><p>The move provides a <strong>fixed outcome</strong>.<br />This method is simple but powerful because it is reliable and clear. It’s a tool Players can rely on to make something specific happen. This gives them more control over game events, even if the consequences might still be unexpected.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>When you search for lies…</p><p>You will find them, if there are any.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>The move provides <strong>a selection</strong>.<br />This is a great way to shape the narrative in a specific way while allowing Players to have a say on critical descriptive details. As a designer, you can craft a list that offers options that stay in line with a certain type of narrative, that are suggestive and inspiring of a certain style and aesthetic, or that will limit the possible follow-up events to a specific array of outcomes.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>When you look around…</p><p>You can ask one question from...</p><p>[here are a few different examples of lists with specific focuses]</p><p>...this action-focused list:</p><p>Who is my true enemy?</p><p>Where will danger come from?</p><p>What's my best escape route?</p><p>...this emotion-focused list:</p><p>How do they really feel?</p><p>What are the relational ties in play here?</p><p>How can I make them feel X ?</p><p>...this setting-focused list:</p><p>What does their Pah tell me?</p><p>Are there Ley Lines in the vicinity?</p><p>What would a true dragon-born do?</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>The move provides <strong>randomness</strong>.<br />Adding a dice roll can serve many purposes.</p><ul><li>A dice roll can inject inherent tension into the move effect, simply because of the unpredictability of the roll. This can in turn be heightened or dampened through more impactful results: a more rewarding 10+, a more punishing 1-6, or a less reliable 7-9 can all increase the stress of rolling dice, where the opposite will help smooth out the emotional rollercoaster. Both are important options to handle.</li><li>A dice roll can make extreme results feel fair and acceptable. It’s the dice’s fault, not someone’s malicious intervention.</li><li>It can lighten the burden of direct decision-making by letting the dice decide for you.</li><li><p>It can help model a specific scenario: maybe a move is not really supposed to ever “fail” and thus all of its outcomes represent “success” but with different secondary details attached to them; maybe a move will always represent a bad situation, so even the best possible results are quite problematic.<br /><em><strong>Look Around</strong></em> is an example of a move with no real fail state, while <em><strong>Threaten</strong></em> and <em><strong>Brawl</strong></em> represent moves with very problematic outcomes even of successful rolls.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The move asks for <strong>Player input</strong>. This can be used to great effect.</p><ul><li>It can help the World understand what a Protagonist might worry or care about, thanks to direct feedback from their Player.</li><li>It can help the World get direction and inspiration about some new setting element no one has defined until now.</li><li>It can make very negative outcomes more palatable and unproblematic because the Players themselves define them, instead of feeling wronged or humiliated by someone else.</li><li>Most importantly, Player input can be seen as a <strong>cost</strong>: producing narration, even prompted and guided one, takes effort. For some, it might be a delight, for others less so, but it always takes more brain-power than just acknowledging a pre-set outcome or picking from a list, and it adds more personality to the narrative. Consider <strong>rewarding</strong> this effort by designing moves that, in exchange for Player input, grant more positive or less negative effects, depending on how the move works.</li><li>All that said, regardless of the amount of guidance and rewards they provide, be wary of moves that ask for <strong>too much</strong>. Frequent but small input is generally good, as it teaches Players to feel more confident about their contributions to the game. Conversely, infrequent but very complex and demanding input is universally bad, as it can challenge and intimidate even seasoned veterans.</li><li><p>Of course, beware of the opposite extreme too. Too frequent input can, if not carefully shaped and supported, feel draining and even perplexing.<br />The equivalent of <em><strong>Take a Risk</strong></em> in other PbtA games often ends up being the most triggered move of all, with its 7-9 outcome being the most frequent of all, asking the World for <strong>constant</strong> and <strong>repeated</strong> input based on very <strong>vague</strong> directions (<em>a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice</em>).</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>These are the most common and important “structures” you should consider when crafting the effects of a move. Each can be used in isolation to be the core of a whole move that does that thing, or they can be <strong>mixed together</strong> to concoct more articulated moves.</p><blockquote><p>A perfect example is the Look Around move. It presents a simple and clear trigger that maps on a Protagonist action...</p><p>When you observe a situation / place / object…</p><p>Then it establishes a fixed outcome:</p><p>…the World will tell you what is obvious and clear.</p><p>Then it introduces a conditional:</p><p>…and then will ask you: \"Do you want to know more?\"</p><p>Then it asks for Player input:</p><p>If you say YES, explain how you act to get extra info and what you pay close attention to.</p><p>Then it asks for a dice roll.</p><p>Then roll+VIGILANT. During the inspection, you can ask the World questions, one at a time. If you act on the answers, you get an Advantage.</p><p>10+ = ask 2 questions.</p><p>7-9 = ask 1 question.</p><p>1-6 = ask 1 question + World Reaction.</p><p>These results themselves are complex:</p><p>The move models the outcome so that failure is impossible, as the PC always gets to ask at least one question.</p><p>The move heightens the effect of success by granting not only access to fictional knowledge, which would be the obvious result, but by also ensuring that such knowledge is useful no matter its specific nature because acting on it provides Advantage.</p><p>The move also limits the effect of success by only ever granting 1 or 2 questions, instead of 3 or more. This is more about keeping the narrative focus tight and on point, than about maintaining an imaginary and not-so-important \"power balance\" within the game.</p><p>For similar reasons, the move adds a negative outcome (the World Reaction) to the 1-6 result. This makes the 1-6 feel different than the 7-9. And the risk of a worse outcome adds just a touch more tension to a move that is otherwise meant to be very safe.</p><p>Then it offers a list too!</p><p>List of questions:</p><p>Where's my best way out / way in / way past?</p><p>Who is the most vulnerable / threatening to me?</p><p>Who's in control here and now?</p><p>What has happened recently or is about to happen here?</p><p>What is useful or valuable to me here?</p><p>What here is not what it seems?</p><p>What should I focus my attention on?</p><p>These questions serve a double purpose. On one hand, they are a guideline suggesting to the Player some useful options, helping them avoid drawing a blank. On the other hand, they are focused on practicalities that help both Players and World think about solutions and actions, rather than building atmosphere or evoking setting elements. This move is meant to be a simple and often-invoked tool for practical usage, and the available questions reflect this design choice.</p></blockquote><h4>Move Notes</h4><p>An ideal move is self-contained, its trigger and effect conveying all the knowledge needed to use it in play without the need to consult any external source of information. Alas, this is not always possible, and the excessive addition of explanatory text can be more harmful than beneficial. As previously mentioned, it is a difficult balancing act between being direct and succinct, and being clear and unambiguous.</p><p>A helping hand can come from the addition of notes: explanatory text external to the move body, but directly related to it. These should never include <strong>functional</strong> parts of a move or <strong>instructions</strong> Players and World would be required to follow in order for the move to work as intended. But they can be home to <strong>a few comments</strong> aimed at explicating some common misunderstandings, doubts, and edge cases. It is also a good place to offer <strong>examples</strong> and suggestions on how to answer the questions the move might pose to Players and World.</p><h4>Bad Moves</h4><p>Within <em>Fantasy World</em> and its design philosophy it is possible for a move to be formally well structured, with clearly presented trigger and effect, but still be <em>bad</em> by falling victim to some habits and conventions from other games that don’t really work well in FW. There are two common patterns to pay attention to.</p><ol><li>Try at all costs to avoid moves with <strong>purely numerical/mechanical effects</strong> as they don't really “move” the fiction. This is especially true of moves with a trigger that amounts to a passive statement, but even moves with a more proactive trigger are basically a wasted opportunity, bogging down the game with <strong>fictionally inert clutter</strong> for no meaningful gain. A particularly strong trigger might lessen the problem, but arguably this might make the missed opportunity even more of a pity.</li></ol><blockquote><p>You are tough! Get +1 Armor.</p><p>This is my personal definition of a complete waste of space.</p><p>You are arrogant!… use Daring in place of Intense.</p><p>This alters the fiction in an homeopathically inconsequential way. It also mostly affects what the PC's Player would imagine in their own head, adding nearly nothing to what gets described and shared at the game table. If it ain't shared, it ain't there.</p><p>When you, emotionally or relationally, push others away… gain 1 XP.</p><p>This has a powerful trigger, with the effect acting as a hook to entice the Player. And simplicity often equals strength. Good! That said, one wonders if such a purely mechanical effect is not a missed opportunity.</p><p>Why was this move designed? Which themes is it supposed to bring to the fore? Can't the effect also offer some input and guidance about the possible meaning or consequences of the PC's triggering action?</p></blockquote><ol><li><p>Avoid moves with <strong>vague World directions</strong>, as they make the World’s job exceedingly more draining and difficult. Want the outcome to be open, letting the World have their way? Assign them a <em>World Reaction</em>. Want to make the outcome less markedly problematic? Make the <em>World Reaction</em> be <em>Open</em>. Or offer the Player a clear choice. Or offer the World one. Or define a fixed fictional outcome. Whatever you do, just use the <strong>standard jargon</strong> of the game to reference <strong>known rules and mechanics</strong>.<br />Don’t just drop the ball on the World’s lap hoping that they will figure something out. This is <strong>lazy</strong> design <strong>disrespectful</strong> of the energy it takes the World to run the game.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>A very common culprit of this sin is catch-all moves like the ones that originally inspired Take a Risk.</p><p>Such moves tend to offer a clear 10+ : success, you did it.</p><p>They also have a clear 1-6: the World makes a Reaction as open or closed as they want.</p><p>But they fall apart in the middle 7-9 section, as they try to present a partial or problematic success.</p><p>The problem is that the move tells the World what to do, but not how. And it often does it in some poetic, non-standard way. Coming up on the fly with \"a worse outcome, a hard bargain or an ugly choice\" is not always easy. It's usually ok the first time a PC rolls it in a given scene. But when the situation becomes complex and protracted, which is exactly what the moves snowball produces due to its worse/hard/ugly effects, rolling one 7-9 after another, after another, after another gets very old very fast.</p><p>Take a Risk is specifically designed to avoid these and other problems.</p></blockquote><h4>Unorthodox Moves</h4><p>Having expressed the fundamental ideas and best practices informing the design of moves in <em>Fantasy World</em>, there is something to be said about breaking such patterns. It’s a more difficult road, requiring quite a lot of work, effort, and testing. And it’s a more dangerous road, leading more easily to problematic results. But it’s a possible and sometimes very useful road that, if taken carefully and without excess, can yield useful and unique results, examples of which have already been seen throughout this book.</p><ul><li>A move can be used to abstract away a complex situation with just a single mechanic. But on the other hand, it can also be used to zoom in on the details of something. The <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em> and <em><strong>Journey</strong></em> moves are perfect examples of this: in part, they abstract away what could otherwise be a long stretch of game time, something that could even take up multiple sessions, into a single procedure that lasts only a few minutes; but in part, they pretty much frame and orchestrate a whole sequence of mini-scenes. This is accomplished through a quite long and complex text, explaining what to do and how to do it in multiple steps and incorporating multiple mechanics and techniques.</li><li>A move can be used to guide the construction of something. This is usually only worth it if the resulting construct is meant to be very important very often, like the Veteran’s weapon or the <em><strong>Wayfarer</strong></em>’s animal companion.</li><li><p>A move can have multiple segments absolving different functions, like the Core moves of some Classes, where one part is a sort of <strong>passive</strong> one-time questionnaire asking a lot of Player input for the sake of fleshing out their Protagonist’s starting identity, while another part is <strong>active</strong> and follows a normal trigger+effect pattern. Or, for a less overblown example, the effects part of a move might simply list more than one effect: it will do A, and B, and if the conditions are met, it will also do C.<br />There is a very good argument to be made against such <em>aggregated</em> moves, which should probably be crafted as separate moves, each with its own name, a simpler text, and more straightforward usage. But such a <em>Frankenstein</em> move could also provide specific benefits or answer to unique design needs.</p></li></ul><h3>Technique #5 - Designing Classes</h3><p>In <em>Fantasy World</em> a Class is a bundle of moves linked by a common thread. Each Class is introduced with a brief description and a shortlist of 3 themes it might help explore through play. It counts exactly 11 moves, of which 2 are Core ones and 9 are Growth ones.</p><h4>High Concept</h4><p><em>Fantasy World</em> Classes could be seen as narratively neutral by design. They do work as unique <strong>lenses</strong> through which Players can experience the game world, and while this does facilitate the presence of a few broad and universal themes, they don’t really do much in terms of high concept. Being <em>The Weapon Person</em> or <em>The Honor Person</em> or <em>The Magic Person</em> says nothing about the kind of stories the Protagonist will be able to experience, while being <em>The Chosen</em> or <em>The Underdog</em> or <em>The Tragic Love</em> presupposes very specific narrative structures, story arcs, and character roles. In a nutshell, <em>Fantasy World</em> Classes <strong>have no destiny</strong>. The story of each Protagonist will always be what stems from the tension between their personal Issue and Doubt, and the friction with those of other Protagonists.</p><p>When crafting a new Class, the safe bet is thus to stick with fantasy <em>jobs</em>. What set of skills and powers can the Class represent? What activity or approach to action does it portray? Which fantasy elements will it bring into the spotlight? This neutral focus is not strictly necessary, but it is what interferes the least with other core mechanics.</p><h4>Core Moves</h4><p>Each Class starts the game with exactly 2 core moves. These are fixed, not a Player choice, and should both be designed to strongly express the core identity of the Class. This approach has many advantages:</p><ul><li>The amount of information new Players need to know is drastically limited.</li><li>Ill-informed choices, and the time and stress they involve, are eliminated.</li><li>Player focus is kept on concepts, ideas, fiction, and themes, rather than on rules.</li><li>Class identity and expectations are safeguarded, at least as a starting point.</li></ul><p><strong>Personalization</strong> must not be a matter of shopping for this or that power. Uniqueness comes from outside the Class: from Fellowship answers, from Blood and Kin, from Issue and Doubt. Then, additionally, at least one core move from each Class offers a venue for <strong>personal expression</strong> right before the start of the game, while the other move should be simpler and focus more on representing a salient element of the Class.</p><h4>Growth Moves</h4><p>Each Class offers a range of 9 moves that can be accessed through Protagonist growth. These can <strong>reinforce</strong> the ideas expressed by the Core moves, building on them, altering or expanding the original mechanic, or counting on the use of a Core move to then further develop what its effects can mean or what they can accomplish. Growth moves can also be used to <strong>diversify</strong> a class, representing some alternative paths of specialization, or mixing things up by introducing a more story-aware move: fantasy tropes and clichès abound, and this is the place to offer them up for Players to pick and choose.</p><p>Some Growth moves have <strong>requirements</strong>. The rule here is simple:</p><ul><li><p>Growth moves <strong>can</strong> require access to a Core move.<br />This is mainly to represent how some moves make no sense without a specific Core behind them, helping to avoid cross-Class madness. Changing the rules to disregard this limit is not particularly problematic, but will require World and Players to negotiate the if/when/how a move can actually work.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>If a Growth move modifies the way a Protagonist performs magic, and the ability to perform magic is defined by a Core move, what does it mean? Is the Growth move useless? Or can the Protagonist perform magic in some other way, maybe thanks to a Tag or proper fictional positioning, and then affect it with the aforementioned Growth move?</p><p>This is what you'll need to define once you remove the requirement.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Growth moves <strong>should not</strong> require access to other Growth moves.<br />This is a design philosophy choice more than a structural need. All Growth moves within the same Class should immediately be accessible, with no artificial hierarchies or strict progression pathways, no A then B then C. Each Class is already focused and limited enough and should not lock interesting moves behind other ones.</p></li></ul><h4>Moves Harmony</h4><p>There is no specific magic behind the number of moves Fantasy World uses. Simply put, the 2+9 formula seemed to fit the needs of the game. It’s enough to allow for some diversity, with each Class potentially growing into a few different variations of itself, while also being tight and focused enough to prevent diluting the <em>high concept</em> and core themes.<br />The same goes for all Classes being defined by an equal amount of moves. It’s an <strong>aesthetic choice</strong> that I find makes the game easier to use and understand. Other PbtA games are all over the place in this regard but, at least for some of them, I would say that the asymmetry and imbalance in their playbooks (their version of Classes) serves the purposes of each specific game fairly well. Maybe a playbook really does work better with just 2 moves. I am a bit more skeptical about a single playbook needing <strong>28</strong> unique moves, but such games exist too.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"a-fwrpg-test","system":"pbta","coreVersion":"10.291","systemVersion":"0.7.0"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.XRMSr1L8S6aRQBVO"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pbta","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675109314076,"modifiedTime":1675118600040,"lastModifiedBy":"ppN6idFMQw6RyZip"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"ppN6idFMQw6RyZip":3},"_id":"18KiY1HeCHfROE80"}
